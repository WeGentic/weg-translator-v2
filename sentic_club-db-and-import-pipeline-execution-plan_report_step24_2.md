# Step 24.2 Completion Report

## Summary
- Surfaces `hash_sha256` in project detail hydration (`ProjectFileDetails`) and leverages it during conversion planning to recompute SHA-256 hashes for stored originals, caching results per file to minimise repeated I/O.
- Warns (without failing jobs) whenever a recomputed hash diverges from the stored metadata, flagging potential tampering while keeping conversion flows uninterrupted.
- Reused the existing streaming helper `compute_sha256_streaming` and safeguarded resolution through `join_within_project`, logging when paths go out-of-scope or hashing fails.
- Frontend now displays a destructive toast summarising affected files whenever integrity alerts ship with the conversions plan payload.

## Validation
- `cargo test --lib --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `cargo test --test conversion_plan --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `cargo test --test project_conversions --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `cargo test --test ipc_artifacts --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

## Notes
- Hash verification currently runs when conversion plans are built; future work could extend the cached helper to other read paths (e.g., on-demand file download) if required. The cache prevents re-hashing per language pair, keeping overhead modest for multi-target projects.
