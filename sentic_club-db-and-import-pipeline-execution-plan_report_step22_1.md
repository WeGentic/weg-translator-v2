# Step 22.1 Completion Report

## Summary
- Added `src-tauri/tests/schema_migrations.rs` exercising the full SQLx migration stack against a fresh in-memory SQLite database, asserting that reference tables (`users`, `clients`, `domains`) and new pipeline tables (`project_language_pairs`, `file_targets`, `artifacts`, `jobs`, etc.) are created successfully.
- Verified critical schema guarantees by asserting foreign keys (owner/client/domain ties, cascade behaviour), CHECK constraints (lifecycle/status enums), unique indexes, and trigger presence for timestamp/idempotency enforcement.
- Centralized test setup via a `migrated_pool()` helper that applies all migrations through `sqlx::migrate!`, ensuring the test suite fails if any future migration is invalid or out of order.

## Validation
- `cargo test --test schema_migrations --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

## Notes
- Follow-up sweep removed the previously noted `dead_code` warnings by wiring filesystem helpers into live code paths and pruning unused exports, keeping the schema test run clean.
