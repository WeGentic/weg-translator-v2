# Step 3.1 Completion Report

## Summary
- Added `src-tauri/migrations/011_create_project_language_pairs.sql` to create `project_language_pairs` with UUID primary keys, project foreign key (cascade delete), language columns, UTC timestamp default, and uniqueness guard per project/source/target pair.

## Validation
- Pending migration test coverage (Task 22); manual tests not executed for this step.

## Notes
- Service-layer normalization/validation of BCP-47 tags remains scheduled for Task 9.2; this migration simply enforces structural constraints and uniqueness.
