# Task 4 Documentation â€” ProjectManagerToolbar Modernisation

Date: 2025-02-16

## Scope
Task 4 delivered the React 19 migration of the Project Manager toolbar. The modernised implementation now lives entirely under `src/features/project-manager-v2`, preserving the legacy UX while aligning with compiler-driven patterns.

## Key Changes
- Introduced `ProjectManagerToolbar.tsx` in the v2 module with simplified props and consolidated filter mutation helpers, removing `useMemo`/`useCallback` scaffolding from the legacy version.
- Wired `ProjectManagerView.tsx` to the new toolbar export, ensuring view-level state still flows through `handleSearchChange`/`handleFiltersChange` without needing `Dispatch<SetStateAction>` hooks.
- Normalised active-filter calculations across desktop and mobile layouts via pure helpers, maintaining badge and tooltip behaviour without duplicated memo logic.

## Behavioural Verification
- Manual sanity checks confirm search input, filter selectors, clear actions, and mobile popover flows match the documented invariants from Task 1.
- Styling remains identical: all Tailwind classes, palette tokens, and ARIA attributes are unchanged from the legacy implementation.

## Validation
- `pnpm lint` (fails due to pre-existing repository issues; no findings reference the new toolbar files). No additional automated checks run for this task.

## Follow-ups
- Coordinate with Task 5 to evaluate migrating `filterProjects` and shared type exports once remaining v2 modules adopt the new toolbar contract.
- Plan ARIA/keyboard regression sweep (Task 5.2) now that toolbar parity has been achieved without memo hooks.
