# Step 11.1 Completion Report

## Summary
- Updated project directory scaffolding to create `original/` and nested `artifacts` folders (`xliff`, `xjliff`, `qa`) immediately after project creation (`src-tauri/src/ipc/commands/projects/file_operations.rs`).
- Original uploads now persist as `original/<file_id>__<slugified-stem>.<ext>` via shared helper `build_original_stored_rel_path`, reused across imports and seed tooling (`src-tauri/src/ipc/commands/projects/utils.rs`, `src-tauri/src/bin/seed_demo_project.rs`).
- XLIFF/JLIFF planning outputs target the new hierarchy (`artifacts/<kind>/<src>__<trg>/<file_id>.*`) ensuring future tasks can rely on consistent layout (`src-tauri/src/ipc/commands/projects/artifacts.rs`).

## Validation
- `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` *(fails: longstanding doctest harness issues; unit tests pass before doctest phase aborts).* No additional automated checks executed.

## Notes
- Helper `build_original_stored_rel_path` is exported for shared use, keeping filesystem conventions centralized as we evolve import and staging flows.
