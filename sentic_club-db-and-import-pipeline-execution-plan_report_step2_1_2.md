# Step 2.1.2 Completion Report

## Summary
- Extended `src-tauri/migrations/010_alter_projects_add_lifecycle_and_refs.sql` with the `ux_projects_owner_name` filtered unique index and `trg_projects_updated_at` trigger to keep `updated_at` in sync after updates.
- Trigger uses a guard on `updated_at` equality to avoid recursive re-entry while still ensuring timestamp refreshes.

## Validation
- No automated migrations tests executed yet; scheduled for Task 22.

## Notes
- Index enforces case-insensitive uniqueness for active project names per owner, aligning with plan constraints.
