  <step-1 description="Preparation">
    <objectives>Gather all necessary context before questioning</objectives>
    <requirements>
      [ ] `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_UserInput.json` exists and is valid JSON.
      [ ] `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_CodebaseAnalysis.json` exists and is valid JSON.
      [ ] `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_Requirements.json` exists and is valid JSON.
      [ ] `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_Design.json` exists and is valid JSON.
    </requirements>
    <actions>
      1. Read IN FULL and understand the following documents before creating any question/answer session:
        - `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_UserInput.json`
        - `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_CodebaseAnalysis.json`
        - `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_Requirements.json`
        - `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_Design.json`
    </actions>
  </step-1>
  <step-2 description="Generate questions"></step-2>
    <objectives>Identify and fill all technical gaps through targeted questioning</objectives>
    <actions>
      1. Before generating each question, thoroughly analyze all previously read documents to identify ambiguities, missing details
      2. For each identified gap, generate a specific, targeted question to clarify the requirement
      3. Follow these guidelines when crafting questions:
        - **Be Specific**: Ask about concrete technical details, not vague concepts
        - **Reference Context**: Cite existing codebase patterns from `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_CodebaseAnalysis.json` when relevant
        - **Evaluate Impact**: Think deeply about why each question matters for the implementation
        - **Progressive Depth**: Start with blocking questions, then drill into details
        - Use @Agent-Plan and/or sequential-thinking MCP tool to systematically break down the requirements into specific, targeted questions. Some examples, non-exhaustive and non-limiting, include:
          - What is the current most updated (Oct 2025) best practice for...
          - How is [specific technology/concept] actually (Oct 2025) typically implemented in [specific context]?
          - What are the current and most updated (Oct 2025) technical considerations for...
          - What are common pitfalls when implementing...
          - What are actual (Oct 2025) the edge cases to consider when...
          - What are the actual (Oct 2025) recommended strategies for handling...
    </actions>
  </step-2>
  <step-3 description="Conduct Q&A Session">
    <objectives>Where pertinent, provide one or more answers to all questions</objectives>
    <actions>
      1. For each generated question, seek definitive answers using the following process:
        - Find authoritative answers using the Perplexity-ask MCP tool and WebSearch tool
        - Mark the preferred answer if multiple answers are found
      2. Follow these guidelines when seeking answers:
        - **Exhaust All Resources**: Use both automated tools and user input as needed
        - **Clarify Ambiguities**: If answers are vague, ask follow-up questions
        - **Document Thoroughly**: Record all Q&A interactions in detail
      3. Continue this iterative Q&A process until:
        - All BLOCKING and HIGH priority questions are answered
        - You have enough detail to write precise implementation specifications
        - Technical debt implications are understood and accepted
        - The user confirms the requirements summary is complete
      4. End the session when:
        - All BLOCKING and HIGH priority questions are answered
        - You have enough detail to write precise implementation specifications
        - Technical debt implications are understood and accepted
        - The user confirms the requirements summary is complete

  <step-4 description="Final Review and Output">
      1. Review for clarity, conciseness, and adherence to constraints
      2. Ensure JSON validates against schema in `.claude/schemas/qa.json`
      3. If all checks pass, proceed to generate output JSON
      4. If any check fails, revise accordingly before output
      5. Create `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_UserQA.json` validating against `.claude/schemas/qa.json`
