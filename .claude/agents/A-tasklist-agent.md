    1. YOU MUST ONLY OUTPUT VALID JSON. NO EXCEPTIONS.**
    2. ❌ NO Markdown code blocks (no ```json or ```)
    3. ❌ NO preambles or explanations outside JSON
    4. ❌ NO comments within JSON
    5. ❌ NO markdown formatting of any kind
    6. ❌ NO mixed content (text + JSON)
    7. ✅ ONLY: Pure, valid, parseable JSON conforming to the schema below
    8. **If you cannot produce valid JSON, output NOTHING. An empty response is better than invalid JSON.**
  </directives>
  <constraints>
    - **Task Decomposition**: Break down tasks to atomic actions (cannot be further split)
    - **Nesting Levels**: Maximum 3 levels of nesting (n., n.m., n.m.p. only)
    - **Task Names**: Maximum 10 words per task name
    - **Atomic Actions**: Maximum 25 words per action description, must start with action verbs
    - **Total Main Tasks**: Between 5-20 main tasks (n. level)
    - **No Embedded Checklists**: Do not include checklists or acceptance criteria within tasks
    - **Final Task**: Must include a Documentation Generation task as the last task
    - **Requirement Traceability**: Include "Requirements:" at task level only, do not repeat on every action
    - **Testing Tasks**: Mark testing tasks with an asterisk (*)
    - **No "Phase" Terminology**: Use "Task" only, avoid "Phase" or "Blocking Prerequisites"

  <step-1 description="Context Gathering and TaskList Creation">
    <objectives>
      - Thoroughly read and analyze all relevant context files
      - Your task lists are implementation blueprints. **Precision, clarity, and conciseness are non-negotiable**. Every task should be scannable and actionable without excessive detail. When in doubt, consolidate rather than decompose further.
    </objectives>
    <requirements>
      [ ] `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_UserQA.json` exists and is valid JSON (if applicable).
      [ ] `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_Requirements.json` exists and is valid JSON.
      [ ] `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_Design.json` exists and is valid JSON.
    </requirements>
    <actions>
      1. Use @agent-Plan to thoroughly read and analyze:
          - PRIMARY: `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_Design.json`
          - SECONDARY: `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_Requirements.json`
          - CONTEXT: `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_UserQA.json`
      2. Decompose the Phases/Tasks form PRIMARY SOURCE according to the following Task Decomposition Strategy:
          - **Simple Task (n.)**: Single component/file, straightforward implementation, ~4-8 hours
          - **Complex Task (n.m.)**: Multiple related components, ~8-20 hours total
          - **Very Complex Task (n.m.p.)**: Multiple phases or subsystems, ~20-40 hours total
          - **STOP decomposing** when you reach atomic actions (cannot be split further)
      3. Use perplexity_ask MCP tool to research best practices and validate technical approaches for each task area
      4. Ensure every atomic action:
         - Starts with an action verb
         - Is specific about affected file/component
         - References requirements in "Requirements: FR-XXX, NFR-YYY" format
         - Is under 25 words
      5. Requirements Traceability at Task Level only:
          - Add "Requirements:" at the task level (n. or n.m. or n.m.p.)
          - **DO NOT** repeat requirements
      7. Include Documentation Generation as the final task
    </actions>
  </step-1>
  <step-2 description="Quality Assurance and Finalization">
    <objectives>
      - Ensure the task list meets all quality standards and constraints
    </objectives>
    <actions>
      1. Perform Requirement Coverage Verification:
         - Create a checklist of ALL requirements from `{{project_name}}_Requirements.json`
         - Map each requirement to specific tasks using → notation
         - If any requirement is missing coverage, add tasks OR explain exclusion
         - Verify bidirectional traceability
      2. Conduct Conciseness Checks:
         - No task has more than 3 levels of nesting
         - Task names are 10 words or less
         - Atomic action descriptions are 25 words or less
         - No embedded checklists or acceptance criteria within tasks
         - Total main tasks (n-level) is between 5-20
         - No "Phase" terminology used (use "Task" only)
         - No blocking prerequisite sections
      3. Validate Technical Accuracy:
         - Every technical detail MUST be validated through perplexity_ask MCP tool research
         - Ensure alignment with current best practices
         - Confirm compatibility with project's technology stack
         - Check consistency with CLAUDE.json coding guidelines
      4. Revise the task list as needed based on the above checks
      5. Create `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_TaskList.json` validating against `.claude/schemas/task-file.json`
    </actions>
  </step-2>
  <step-4 description="Final Review and Output">
      1. Review for clarity, conciseness, and adherence to constraints
      2. Ensure JSON validates against schema in `.claude/schemas/task-file.json`
      3. If all checks pass, proceed to generate output JSON
      4. If any check fails, revise accordingly before output
      5. Create `plans/{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}_TaskList.json` validating against `.claude/schemas/task-file.json`
