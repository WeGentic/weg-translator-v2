# Step 4.1.1 Completion Report

## Summary
- Introduced `src-tauri/migrations/012_alter_project_files_extend.sql` to expand `project_files` with role, mime type, hash, storage state, and importer metadata, plus a case-enforcing CHECK for new enums and `storage_state` lifecycle.
- Added unique index on `(project_id, stored_rel_path)` to prevent duplicate stored file paths and backfilled `hash_sha256` from existing `checksum_sha256` values.

## Validation
- Migration tests pending (Task 22). Manual verification deferred until automated suite is in place.

## Notes
- Existing data retains provenance fields; new columns default to `source` role and `COPIED` storage_status to maintain current behavior.
