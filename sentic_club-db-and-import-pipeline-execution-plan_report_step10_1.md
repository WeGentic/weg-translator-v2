# Step 10.1 Completion Report

## Summary
- Updated `DbManager::connect_pool` (`src-tauri/src/db/manager.rs`) to execute `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`, `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`, and `PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL` immediately after acquiring a connection, ensuring runtime pool settings align with plan guidance.

## Validation
- No automated checks run specifically for this change; behavior will be exercised in migration tests under Task 22.

## Notes
- PRAGMA configuration precedes migrations so both runtime and migrator operate with consistent durability and FK enforcement settings.
