# Step 16.1 Completion Report

## Summary
- Added a database backfill that guarantees the placeholder `local-user` exists and reassigns any orphaned projects to that owner during application startup (`src-tauri/src/db/operations/projects.rs`, `src-tauri/src/ipc/commands/projects/constants.rs`, `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`).

## Validation
- `cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `npm run lint` *(fails due to pre-existing UI lint warnings unrelated to this change).* 

## Notes
- Startup logs now surface when projects are updated, providing operators immediate feedback that legacy records were normalized.
