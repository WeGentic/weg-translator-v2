# Step 5.1 Completion Report

## Summary
- Added `src-tauri/migrations/013_create_file_targets.sql` creating the `file_targets` table with cascaded foreign keys to `project_files` and `project_language_pairs`, status enum CHECK, UTC timestamp defaults, and uniqueness per file/pair.
- Included `trg_file_targets_updated_at` trigger to keep `updated_at` synchronized on row updates while guarding against recursive updates.

## Validation
- Migration tests not yet executed; will be covered in Task 22.

## Notes
- Structure establishes the new junction table needed for mapping project files to language pairs ahead of artifact generation flows.
