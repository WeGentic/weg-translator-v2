# Project Implementation Progress

Tracking execution of `docs/ProjectSpecificPagePlan.md` milestones.

| Step | Description | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ----- |
| 1 | Review existing database schema and backend code to align upcoming migrations. | ✅ Completed | Reviewed `src-tauri/migrations` and `src-tauri/src/db/mod.rs` to understand current project/project_files structures. |
| 2 | Add migrations 006 and 007 for project languages and file conversions. | ✅ Completed | Authored migrations 006/007 to extend project metadata and conversion tracking tables. |
| 3 | Extend DbManager data models and CRUD helpers for conversions and project details. | ✅ Completed | Added conversion models/enums and implemented new DbManager CRUD/query helpers plus filesystem utilities. |
| 4 | Outline updates needed for IPC layer and frontend (post-backend groundwork). | ✅ Completed | Captured next IPC/frontend tasks in `docs/backend-groundwork-documentation.md`. |
| 5 | Add IPC DTOs for project details and conversions. | ✅ Completed | Added DTOs in `src-tauri/src/ipc/dto.rs` for files, conversions, details, add-files, and conversion plans. |
| 6 | Implement project IPC commands (details, add/remove files, conversions plan, status update). | ✅ Completed | Added commands in `src-tauri/src/ipc/commands.rs` and exported in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`. |
| 7 | Capabilities review for sidecars/permissions. | ✅ Completed | No changes needed; existing capabilities already allow sidecars. |
| 11 | Add frontend IPC wrappers for new commands. | ✅ Completed | Implemented in `src/ipc/client.ts` with types in `src/ipc/types.ts`. |
