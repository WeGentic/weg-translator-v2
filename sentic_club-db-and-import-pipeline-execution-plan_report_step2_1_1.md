# Step 2.1.1 Completion Report

## Summary
- Added lifecycle and reference columns to `projects` via `src-tauri/migrations/010_alter_projects_add_lifecycle_and_refs.sql`, including owner, client, and domain foreign keys plus lifecycle status and archival timestamp.
- Seeded placeholder `local-user` owner (email `local@localhost`) to preserve legacy project creation until owners are assigned explicitly in later tasks.

## Validation
- No automated tests executed for this migration yet; coverage will come with planned migration test suite in Task 22.

## Notes
- Placeholder owner ensures legacy inserts continue succeeding while enforcing the new foreign key. Will be revisited during Task 16 backfill and Task 18 service updates.
