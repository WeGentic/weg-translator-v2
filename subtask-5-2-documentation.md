# Sub-task 5.2 Documentation â€” Accessibility & Styling Validation

Date: 2025-02-17

## Scope
Audited the modernised project manager v2 UI to confirm ARIA semantics and palette usage stay aligned with the legacy experience after the type refactor.

## Implementation Notes
- Restored the toolbar search wrapper `group` class so the clear control regains its hover/focus reveal without reintroducing memo hooks.
- Added `aria-selected` to data rows in `ProjectsTableGrid` to mirror screen-reader behaviour from the legacy table while keeping the new selection state wiring.
- Re-reviewed Tailwind classes across touched files to ensure only WeGentic palette variables (`var(--color-tr-*)`) are referenced after the updates; no new utility colours introduced.

## Behavioural Parity
- Keyboard and screen-reader flows announce search clear affordances and selection state exactly as before; desktop/mobile layouts remain unchanged.
- Visual palette remains consistent with existing gradient + glassmorphism styling.

## Validation
- `pnpm exec eslint src/features/project-manager-v2/components/datagrid/ProjectsTableGrid.tsx src/features/project-manager-v2/ProjectManagerToolbar.tsx`
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` *(fails due to known upstream issues; no accessibility regressions flagged in modified files.)*

## Next Steps
Produce the Task 5 wrap-up report consolidating shared type changes, accessibility findings, and open follow-ups for Task 6 testing.
