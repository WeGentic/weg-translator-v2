# Task 1 Documentation â€” Establish Baseline & Invariants

Date: 2025-02-14

## Completed Deliverables
- Behavioural audit (`subtask-1-1-documentation.md`) capturing state/effect diagrams, UI invariants, and integration contracts.
- Tooling readiness & memoization inventory (`subtask-1-2-documentation.md`).
- Migration strategy and directory layout (`subtask-1-3-documentation.md`) plus `project-manager-v2-migration-matrix.md`.
- Consolidated modernization baseline (`task-1-analysis-report.md`).

## Highlights
- Confirmed React 19 compiler tooling is active (Babel + ESLint) with no gaps.
- Documented selection/polling/dialog invariants to prevent regressions during refactor.
- Classified all legacy files as refactor vs copy-only to guide work inside `src/features/project-manager-v2`.

## Next Actions
Proceed with Task 2 (modernize `ProjectManagerView` within the new module) using the baseline artifacts as reference.
