# combobox-search-fix

## Current User Request Analysis
- Review `.wizard-v2-combobox-search` styles in `src/modules/wizards/project/css/project-wizard-combobox.css`.
- Compare against `.client-search-input` styles in `src/modules/clients/view/client-search.css` to identify mismatches (padding, background, placeholder, vendor overrides).

## Problem Breakdown
- Need to mirror the client search styling for the project wizard combobox input without impacting unrelated selectors.
- Confirm dependencies: both styles rely on theme CSS variables; no additional imports required.
- Implementation steps: inspect current rules, replicate declarations (base, hover, focus, placeholder, vendor overrides), ensure no conflicting styles remain.
- Potential challenge: large CSS fileâ€”take care to edit only the relevant selectors and preserve existing formatting.
- Maintainability: keep scope limited to combobox search selectors to comply with single-responsibility.

## User Request
S1: Fix combobox search in `src/modules/wizards/project/css/project-wizard-combobox.css` -> It must replicate exactly `src/modules/clients/view/client-search.css`
Completed: NOT COMPLETED

## Coding implementation
- Re-scoped the copied styles to `.wizard-v2-search-input` so the actual input mirrors the client search visual treatment, while returning `.wizard-v2-combobox-search` to a simple flex container.
- Restored absolute positioning for `.wizard-v2-search-icon` and ensured the input flexes to full width.

## Notes
- Need user confirmation on alignment and background; ready to tweak once feedback arrives.
