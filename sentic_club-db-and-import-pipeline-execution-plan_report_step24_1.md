# Step 24.1 Completion Report

## Summary
- Sanitized language-specific artifact directories via `build_language_directory_name` and tightened `DbManager::ensure_subdir` validation to reject multi-segment or parent-directory inputs, closing traversal vectors introduced by user-controlled language codes.
- Updated artifact planning to join stored paths through `join_within_project`, ensuring conversion tasks cannot reference files outside the project root even if legacy data is malformed.
- Extended unit coverage around the new sanitizers and subdirectory guard, and confirmed the existing OpenXLIFF sidecar capability allowlist remains sufficient (no new flags introduced).

## Validation
- `cargo test --lib --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `cargo test --test conversion_plan --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `cargo test --test project_conversions --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `cargo test --test ipc_artifacts --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

## Notes
- Existing artifact folders keep their original casing; sanitization only collapses unsafe characters, preserving compatibility with previously generated outputs.
