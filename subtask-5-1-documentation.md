# Sub-task 5.1 Documentation — Shared Types & Utilities Refresh

Date: 2025-02-17

## Scope
Refined the project manager v2 type surface and project filtering helper so the React 19 compiler can rely on immutable defaults while keeping the legacy module untouched.

## Implementation Notes
- Introduced immutable filter definitions and discriminated `TableFiltersPatch` union in `src/features/project-manager-v2/types/types.ts`, plus helpers (`applyTableFiltersPatch`, `countActiveFilters`, `createDefaultTableControlsState`) to centralise state mutations.
- Updated `ProjectManagerView.tsx` and `ProjectManagerToolbar.tsx` to consume the new helpers, remove local duplication, and rely on referential checks when emitting filter changes.
- Added `src/features/project-manager-v2/utils/filterProjects.ts` with typed time-window thresholds and reused search field list; rerouted the view to the local selector.
- Normalised selection props to `ReadonlySet<string>` across `ProjectManagerContent`, table grid, and column builders to align with immutable state guidance.

## Behavioural Parity
- Filtering logic, search matching, and toolbar clear/reset flows match the legacy module while benefiting from the typed patch helpers.
- Table sorting and selection continue to function identically; only internal typings changed.

## Validation
- `pnpm exec eslint src/features/project-manager-v2/ProjectManagerToolbar.tsx src/features/project-manager-v2/ProjectManagerView.tsx src/features/project-manager-v2/components/datagrid/ProjectsTableGrid.tsx src/features/project-manager-v2/types/types.ts src/features/project-manager-v2/utils/filterProjects.ts src/features/project-manager-v2/ProjectManagerContent.tsx`
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` *(fails because of pre-existing type errors in unrelated packages—see run log; no new errors reported for the touched files).* 

## Next Steps
Leverage the centralised helpers during accessibility review (Sub-task 5.2) and plan Task 6 test coverage on top of the stabilised type surface.
