# Executive Report

## Summary

- Established **supabase-registration-flow** plan aligning the existing React/Tauri registration experience with Supabase Auth, Edge Functions, and secure Postgres persistence.
- Documented current codebase state: Supabase client and Auth provider already exist, yet registration submission is stubbed and lacks backend integration.
- Captured four must-have requirements covering verified sign-up, transactional organization persistence, developer SQL provisioning, and security compliance.
- Designed architecture featuring a dedicated submission hook, verification dialog, `register_organization` Edge Function, and RLS-protected schema.
- Produced granular implementation tasks grounded in current best practices (2024–2025) for Supabase sign-up flows and Edge Functions.
- Delivered FreeMind mindmap summarizing objectives, requirements, design, and work packages.
- Completed Task 1 by adding a tracked `.env.example`, tightening Supabase client guard messaging, and documenting local/CI export steps in the README.
- Completed Task 2 SQL authoring: introduced `supabase/sql/register_organization_schema.sql` with company/admin tables, indexes, RLS policies, and an Edge Function helper role.
- Completed Task 3 by implementing `register_organization` Edge Function with JWT/email verification, transactional inserts, structured error responses, and correlation-aware logging.
- Completed Task 4 by implementing `useRegistrationSubmission` with sign-up, verification polling/backoff, manual retry, and Edge Function persistence, integrating it into `useRegistrationForm`/`RegistrationForm` with locked states and toast/log feedback.
- Completed Task 5 by adding the verification dialog UI that reflects submission phases, exposes a manual “I verified” action, and closes cleanly after success or reset.
- Completed Task 6 by wiring persistence success into local profile sync (via IPC), logging outcomes, and redirecting the user to the login screen after confirmation.
- Completed Task 7 by tightening auth gating—unverified users are blocked from workspace routes, login rejections are logged, and no service worker caches Supabase responses.

## Manual Verification Checklist (Task 8)

1. Launch the app with a fresh Supabase email address and walk through the registration steps.
2. Submit the form and ensure the verification dialog appears with the attempt ID.
3. Confirm the email via the Supabase verification link.
4. Return to the dialog, choose “I verified my email”, and confirm the success state lists the company/admin IDs.
5. Continue to the login screen and verify that attempting to sign in before email confirmation shows the “verify your email” warning.

## Next Actions

1. Review and approve the requirements/design with stakeholders, especially around transactional scope and RLS expectations.
2. Stand up a Supabase staging project and execute the provisioning SQL to validate schema and policies (Task 2.3 validation step pending).
3. Tackle Task 8 testing: add hook/dialog coverage, Edge Function tests, and manual verification checklist.
4. Assign owners for Edge Function vs. frontend workstreams; coordinate integration testing windows once both sides are ready.
