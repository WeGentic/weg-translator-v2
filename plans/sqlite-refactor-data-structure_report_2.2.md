# Step 2.2 Report â€” PRAGMA Configuration Refined

- **Scope**: Ensured every SQLite connection enforces the required PRAGMAs (A5) and removed the legacy, single-shot configuration path.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added an `after_connect` hook in `src-tauri/src/db/manager.rs:97` to execute `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`, `PRAGMA recursive_triggers = OFF`, plus the configured journal and synchronous modes for each pooled connection.
  - Deleted the previous post-connection PRAGMA executions, eliminating reliance on legacy migration-era setup.
- **Verification**: `cargo check` from `src-tauri` passes, confirming the manager compiles after rework.
- **Open Items**: Next step (2.3) will address unconditional database resets per requirements.
