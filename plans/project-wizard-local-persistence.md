# Project Wizard Local Persistence
        
## Current User Request Analysis
- Need to add in-session persistence so users can resume an unfinished project wizard without re-entering details.
- Existing wizard state lives in `CreateProjectWizardV2.tsx` with local `useState` hooks; no persistence utilities are present today.

## Problem Breakdown
- Identify all wizard fields and file queue state that should survive dialog close/reopen, including the active step.
- Design a sessionStorage-backed snapshot format that is serializable and resilient to missing/legacy fields.
- Extend the wizard file hook so hydrated snapshots can seed draft files without breaking ID management or role logic.
- Wire persistence into the wizard lifecycle: hydrate once when the dialog opens, persist on meaningful changes, and clear when the wizard resets or submits.
- Add focused coverage to guard serialization/deserialization helpers and ensure they ignore malformed snapshots.

## User Request
S1: Create a local, in-session persistence mechanics for the Project wizard, that stores unfinished projects
Completed: IN REVIEW
        
## Coding implementation
- Added `draftStorage.ts` with load/persist/clear helpers that sanitize snapshots before hydrating the wizard.
- Seeded `CreateProjectWizardV2` state from stored snapshots, wired sessionStorage persistence, and avoided wiping drafts on dialog close.
- Extended `useWizardFiles` to accept hydrated drafts while preserving ID sequencing for new uploads.
- Covered serialization edge cases with `draftStorage.test.ts` (Vitest) and verified via `npm run test -- draftStorage`.
