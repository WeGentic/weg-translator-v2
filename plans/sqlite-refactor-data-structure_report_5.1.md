# Step 5.1 Report — Backend Tests for Refactored Schema

- **Scope**: Added end-to-end coverage for the new database schema using the public `DbManager` API (A4, A11, A16–A19).
- **Key Changes**:
  - Introduced `src-tauri/tests/db_manager_v2.rs` to exercise user/client/project creation, file attachment and detachment, and the non-empty language pair requirement enforced by triggers.
  - Re-exported the schema DTOs from `lib.rs` so tests and future consumers can construct typed arguments without peeking into private modules.
- **Verification**: `cargo test db_manager_v2 --tests` passes, confirming the new flows behave as expected.
- **Open Items**: Broader IPC smoke tests remain for Step 5.2.
