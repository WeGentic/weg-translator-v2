# clients-table-css

## Current User Request Analysis
- The user requested a dedicated CSS file for `src/modules/clients/view/components/ClientsTable.tsx`.
- Current styling for the table relies on Tailwind-like utility classes in JSX and shared selectors defined in `src/modules/clients/view/clients-view.css` such as `.clients-table-main-zone`, `.clients-table-skeleton`, and `.clients-table-checkbox`.

## Problem Breakdown
- Existing code has `ClientsTable.tsx` without a co-located stylesheet import while referencing globally scoped table classes.
- Needed steps: create a component-focused stylesheet (e.g., `clients-table.css`), migrate relevant selectors from `clients-view.css`, and import the stylesheet inside the component module.
- Dependencies include `columns.tsx`, which applies `.clients-table-checkbox`; the extracted CSS must stay available to both files without breaking encapsulation.
- Potential challenges: avoid regressions when removing selectors from `clients-view.css`, keep theme variable usage consistent, and ensure no other modules depend on the moved rules.
- Maintainability goal: constrain the new CSS file to table-specific concerns, respecting project naming conventions and React 19 styling guidelines.

## User Request
S1: Create a specific css file for src/modules/clients/view/components/ClientsTable.tsx
Completed: COMPLETED

## Coding implementation
- Added `src/modules/clients/view/components/clients-table.css` to host table container, skeleton, and checkbox overrides using shared theme tokens.
- Imported the new stylesheet in `ClientsTable.tsx` and `columns.tsx`, and pruned duplicated rules from `clients-view.css`.

## Notes
- Corrected the checkbox accent color token to use the defined `--color-writers-parchment-50` variable so checked states render with the intended palette.
