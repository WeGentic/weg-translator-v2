# Step 5.2 Report — Frontend Checks Green

- **Scope**: Validated the renderer against the new IPC adapters, ensuring TypeScript and ESLint guardrails stay clean (A4, A21–A23).
- **Key Changes**:
  - Removed the manual reset effect in `WizardDetailsStep`, relying on keyed remounts to satisfy the lint rule while keeping UX equivalent.
  - Confirmed language-pair validation integrates smoothly with the project wizard and broader state updates.
- **Verification**: `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` now pass with zero repository warnings beyond the workspace notice.
- **Open Items**: Proceed to Step 5.3 for final legacy cleanup and documentation updates.
