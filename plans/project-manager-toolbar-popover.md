# project-manager-toolbar-popover

## Current User Request Analysis
- User requests aligning the small-width filters popover styling with the existing large-width filter controls in `src/modules/project-manager/ProjectManagerToolbar.tsx`.
- Current implementation shows a styling gap: desktop selects reuse the shared `project-filter-trigger` CSS and custom `SelectContent` item classes, while the popover uses default shadcn/ui styles.

## Problem Breakdown
- Confirm how desktop filter controls are styled (custom trigger class, themed select content/items) and identify reusable pieces.
- Update the mobile/popover `SelectTrigger`, `SelectContent`, and `SelectItem` elements to reuse the same styling primitives without duplicating logic.
- Ensure the popover badge/count and overall layout remain unchanged while matching colors, focus, and hover states from desktop controls.
- Verify that no additional dependencies or shared utilities are required; prefer reusing existing CSS class `project-filter-trigger` and theme-aware classes.
- Keep the change minimal, scoped to the toolbar component to maintain maintainability and respect existing architecture.

## User Request
S1: Fix {/* Small Width Filters - Popover */}: apply the same exact style as same filters for larger width. Context: `src/modules/project-manager/ProjectManagerToolbar.tsx`
Completed: NOT COMPLETED

## Coding implementation
- Introduced reusable class constants in `ProjectManagerToolbar.tsx` for select triggers, content, and items to ensure desktop and mobile variants stay aligned.
- Updated the popover select triggers, contents, and items to reuse the same styling as the desktop controls, including consistent placeholders.
