# registration-flow-email-verification-removal

## Current User Request Analysis
- The user needs the registration flow documentation updated to remove requirements and logic tied to email verification.
- Existing `RegistrationFlow.md` still documents a verification-gated process with polling, dialogs, and related Supabase phases that no longer apply.

## Problem Breakdown
- The documentation describes form hooks, submission handlers, and Supabase phases that assume verification-required states; these sections must be revised to reflect immediate account creation.
- Core components (`RegistrationForm`, submission hooks, edge function invocation) remain, but references to verification dialogs, polling, and status probes need pruning or reframing.
- Only documentation changes are requested; no runtime modifications unless explicitly discovered as necessary for consistency.
- Key challenge is ensuring every mention of verification-dependent states (UI, hooks, Supabase settings, RLS context) is either removed or restated so the flow remains coherent.
- Maintainability requires keeping terminology consistent across sections (overview, step-by-step journey, Supabase integration) and ensuring the simplified flow still explains account provisioning via the edge function.

## User Request
S1: RegistrationFlow.md -> Remove code related to email verification, this is NO LONGER NECESSARY FOR USER REGISTRATION, new flow will be Account Creation -> Store Registration info on Supabase -> Account properly created
Completed: NOT COMPLETED

## Coding implementation
- Updated `RegistrationFlow.md` to remove verification-gated steps, refresh Supabase flow diagrams, and align component descriptions with immediate account provisioning.

## Notes
- Supabase guidance confirms disabling email confirmation or marking users confirmed server-side when removing verification gates, ensuring the documentation reflects supported configurations.
