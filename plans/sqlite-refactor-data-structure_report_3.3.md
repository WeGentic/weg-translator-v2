# Step 3.3 Report — DbManager Integrated with New Operations

- **Scope**: Wired the database manager to the new CRUD modules, preparing the backend for IPC migration (A2, A24).
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added orchestration methods in `src-tauri/src/db/manager.rs` that lock writes and delegate to the new `users`, `clients`, `projects_v2`, `artifacts_v2`, and `jobs_v2` operation functions.
  - Imported the new schema DTOs so callers can pass typed inputs/receive typed aggregates (e.g., `NewProjectArgs`, `ProjectBundle`, `UserProfile`).
  - Introduced `DbError::ConstraintViolation` handling across the manager + IPC layer to surface validation errors cleanly.
- **Verification**: `cargo check` (run from `src-tauri`) passes with the expanded manager interface.
- **Next Steps**: Update IPC command handlers to call the new manager methods and remove the legacy operation modules (Step 3.4).
