# project-view-toolbar

## Current User Request Analysis
- The toolbar currently only renders an empty flex container, so there is no visible action area.
- The user wants a right-aligned “Add File” button without wiring functionality yet.

## Problem Breakdown
- Identify the toolbar structure and ensure we respect existing layout containers.
- Introduce a button component consistent with shared UI primitives and align it to the right edge.
- Keep semantics accessible (e.g., ensure height/spacing mirror other toolbars) while leaving handlers stubbed.
- Verify styling integrates with existing utility classes without extra CSS.

## User Request
S1: Add an “Add File” button to `ProjectViewToolbar` and place it at the rightmost side (no click logic yet).
Completed: NOT COMPLETED

## Coding implementation
- Imported the shared `Button` component and rendered an `Add File` button aligned to the right using existing flex utilities while leaving behaviour unimplemented.

## Notes
- `npm run lint` (fails because `ProjectViewContent.tsx` currently has numerous unused symbols; unrelated to toolbar change).
