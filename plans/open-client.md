# open-client

## Current User Request Analysis
- Need to enhance clients workflow so selecting “Open client” in the Clients table adds contextual UI in Sidebar Two and navigates to a client-specific view.
- Sidebar Two currently renders `DashboardQuickActions` for both dashboard and clients views; no state exists for a focused client entry.

## Problem Breakdown
- Identify how the “Open client” action can emit navigation/state to Sidebar Two without disrupting existing dashboard quick actions.
- Extend workspace navigation model to support a client-focused view (likely new `MainView` key) and load client details via IPC.
- Ensure Sidebar Two shows a dismissible chip/button beneath the clients action reflecting the selected client, with text truncated via ellipsis.
- Implement a new client details screen that surfaces stored data and integrates with existing layout/routes.
- Consider cleanup when user dismisses the chip or navigates away; ensure state resets gracefully.

## User Request
S1: - When user is on Clients view and click on Open Client, do the following:
1. Show a smaller, dismissible button with client name (ellipsis) under Client button in sidebar_two
2. Create a Client-specific view that shows Client data
Completed: COMPLETED

## Coding implementation
- Extended workspace navigation to support client-specific view keys and client focus events (`src/app/state/main-view.ts`, `src/modules/workspace/navigation/main-view-persist.ts`, `src/modules/workspace/hooks/useGlobalNavigationEvents.ts`).
- Added sidebar focus state with dismissible compact chip and tied it to client open/clear events (`src/app/shell/layout-sidebar-two.tsx`, `src/app/shell/sidebar-two-content/DashboardQuickActions.tsx`, new CSS).
- Enabled the Clients table action to trigger client focus navigation and built dedicated client detail view with IPC fetch and styling (`src/modules/clients/view/**/*`).
- Integrated the client detail screen into the workspace switchboard (`src/modules/workspace/WorkspacePage.tsx`).
