# Step 2.1 Report — Schema Definitions Replaced

- **Scope**: Implemented new SQLite schema tables per requirements A5–A19, removing all legacy translation-era DDL.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Rebuilt `src-tauri/src/db/schema.rs` to define only the new tables (users, user_roles, user_permission_overrides, clients, projects, project_subjects, project_language_pairs, file_info, project_files, file_language_pairs, artifacts, jobs).
  - Dropped migration backfill helpers and legacy user seeding; initialisation now relies solely on the canonical table list with placeholders for upcoming index/trigger work.
  - Added boolean `is_allowed` flag to `user_permission_overrides` to encode override intent while keeping the composite primary key requested in the plan.
- **Verification**: `cargo check` executed from `src-tauri` to confirm the module compiles with the new definitions.
- **Open Items**: Populate index/trigger arrays (Steps 2.4–2.5) and align DbManager initialisation logic in upcoming steps.
