# wizard-files-role-handling
        
## Current User Request Analysis
- Wizard files step must assign the `UNDEFINED` role to newly added files and allow users to map them to explicit roles before finalizing.
- Finalize action must stay disabled while any queued file keeps the `UNDEFINED` role; role options include Translation, References, Instructions, OCR (restricted), and Image (restricted).

## Problem Breakdown
- Determine how roles are modelled today (`FileRoleValue`, constants, wizard hooks) and extend them to cover `undefined` and `ocr` while keeping compatibility with draft storage and finalize payload builders.
- Update role inference/defaulting logic so `appendPaths` stores new entries with `undefined`, adjust sanitizers, persistence, and tests accordingly; ensure CSS tokens exist for new role badges.
- Refresh the WizardFilesStep UI to surface the unassigned state, limit selectable options based on file extension (reuse existing `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`; need guidance for OCR-eligible extensions), and keep accessibility intact.
- Extend finalize readiness checks (and payload validation) to block when any draft file remains `undefined`; confirm downstream IPC contracts (Rust side) only receive supported role values.
- Potential challenge: OCR eligibility list is unspecifiedâ€”need confirmation to avoid incorrect gating.

## User Request
S1: src/modules/wizards/project -> src/modules/wizards/project/components/WizardFilesStep.tsx Implement these features:
- when user load a new file, automatically set to UNDEFINED
- do not activate FINALIZE button if any file is still set to UNDEFINED, user have to choose an active role (TRANSLATION, REFERENCES, INSTRUCTIONS, OCR (show the choice only for some specified extension), IMAGE (show the choice only for some specified extensions)
Completed: NOT COMPLETED
        
## Coding implementation
        
## Notes
- Need clarification on the exact extension set that should expose the OCR role before changing selection logic.
