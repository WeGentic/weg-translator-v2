# Implementation Plan for supabase-schemas-tool

## Overview

This implementation plan establishes a comprehensive multi-tenant database schema in Supabase PostgreSQL with three core tables (companies, profiles, company_members), Row-Level Security policies, automated triggers, and storage bucket integration. The plan breaks down 30 functional requirements across 9 implementation phases, ensuring strict tenant isolation, backward compatibility with existing authentication flows, and zero schema manipulation capabilities within application code.

**Total Estimated Effort**: 20-33 days (single developer)

**Key Design Adjustments** (from validation):
- Use separate address columns instead of JSONB for better performance
- Implement Supabase CLI type generation workflow (not manual maintenance)
- Add jitter to exponential backoff in orphan detection
- Add explicit `search_path` to SECURITY DEFINER trigger function

- Existing auth flows preserved (Task 6.1.6)
- Local SQLite remains separate from cloud schema
- No breaking changes to auth.users table
- Data migration script for existing records (Task 1.7)
