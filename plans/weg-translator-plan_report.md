# Weg Translator Plan – Progress Log

## Step 3.1 (Clients view scaffolding)
- Created `ClientsView`, `ClientsHeader`, `ClientsToolbar`, and `ClientsContent` components in `src/modules/clients/view/` mirroring the dashboard layout semantics with clients-specific ids and aria attributes.
- Added `src/modules/clients/view/index.ts` and `src/modules/clients/index.ts` to expose the new view for workspace integration.
- Verified structure via `pnpm typecheck`; command currently fails because `@wegentic/layout-projects-host` types are missing in existing modules, unrelated to this change.

## Step 3.2 (Clients header implementation)
- Replaced placeholder copy in `src/modules/clients/view/ClientsHeader.tsx` with production text and supporting description while keeping the dashboard header styling.
- Added a descriptive paragraph to prompt users about managing client organizations and wired `ClientsView` with `aria-describedby` for accessible context.
- Re-ran `pnpm typecheck`; it still fails due to the unresolved `@wegentic/layout-projects-host` dependency surfaced prior to these changes.

## Step 3.3 (Clients toolbar interaction layer)
- Implemented `ClientsToolbar` with searchable input, contact-based filter select, and an Add Client CTA using shared UI primitives and accessible labelling (`src/modules/clients/view/ClientsToolbar.tsx`).
- Wired `ClientsView` to manage toolbar state, surface the dialog trigger, and bootstrap `WizardNewClientDialog` with the current search term for faster client creation (`src/modules/clients/view/ClientsView.tsx`).
- Verified interaction wiring manually; `pnpm typecheck` still flags the pre-existing `@wegentic/layout-projects-host` missing dependency.

## Step 3.4 (Clients table foundation)
- Replaced the placeholder content zone with a TanStack Table setup that handles sorting, global search, and contact-based filtering while surfacing loading/error placeholders (`src/modules/clients/view/ClientsContent.tsx`).
- Added table primitives in `src/modules/clients/view/components/ClientsTable.tsx` for consistent styling, empty states tied to search/filter context, and a lightweight skeleton loader.
- Authored `src/modules/clients/view/components/columns.tsx` to define the client column schema, format optional fields gracefully, and expose the `ClientRow` mapper for upcoming data hooks.
- `pnpm typecheck` continues to error on the missing `@wegentic/layout-projects-host` package in editor/settings modules; no new regressions introduced.

## Step 4.1 (Clients data hook & integration)
- Added `useClientsData` in `src/modules/clients/hooks/useClientsData.ts` to load client records via IPC, centralise search/filter logic, expose refresh/upsert helpers, and normalise optional fields.
- Refactored `ClientsView` to consume the new hook, wire the retry path, and submit new clients through `createClientRecord` before synchronising local state (`src/modules/clients/view/ClientsView.tsx`).
- Shared filter metadata via `src/modules/clients/constants.ts` so the toolbar, table, and hook operate against a single source of truth.
- Updated `ClientsContent` to rely on the hook’s filtered data while keeping TanStack Table sorting, empty-state messaging, and error handling intact (`src/modules/clients/view/ClientsContent.tsx`).
- `pnpm typecheck` still reports the pre-existing `@wegentic/layout-projects-host` module absence in editor/settings modules; otherwise changes compile cleanly.

## Step 4.2 (Clients view styling)
- Authored `src/modules/clients/view/clients-view.css` to style the content region, table wrapper, hover/focus treatments, and skeleton states using the project palette tokens and responsive spacing.
- Imported the stylesheet in `ClientsView` and tagged the content wrapper to pick up the new layout rules (`src/modules/clients/view/ClientsView.tsx`, `ClientsContent.tsx`).
- Ensured the table hover states include fallbacks when `color-mix` is unavailable, keeping accessibility contrast intact.
- `pnpm typecheck` continues to fail only on the existing external dependency gap (`@wegentic/layout-projects-host`).

## Step 4.3 (Quality gates & automation)
- Added `src/modules/clients/__tests__/useClientsData.test.tsx` to cover loading, search/filter behaviour, optimistic updates, and refresh flows for the new hook while mocking IPC boundaries.
- Extended `WorkspacePage` navigation tests to assert that `app:navigate` events with `view: "clients"` render the clients surface using a stubbed module (`src/modules/workspace/__tests__/WorkspacePage.test.tsx`).
- Tightened navigation plumbing by recognising the clients view in `MainView`, `useGlobalNavigationEvents`, and `WorkspacePage`, ensuring the new tests reflect runtime behaviour.
- Ran `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm test`; each command still reports pre-existing issues (`@wegentic/layout-projects-host` type module, legacy lint regex rule, wizard drag-drop warnings) but no regressions from this work.
