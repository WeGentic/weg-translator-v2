# client-wizard-css-refactor

## Current User Request Analysis
- Separate the existing `client-wizard.css` and `client-form.css` styles into scoped files grouped by role and move them under a dedicated CSS directory.
- Current implementation keeps all wizard-related classes in two flat files inside `src/modules/wizards/client/`; the dialog component `WizardNewClientDialog.tsx` imports both and applies diverse concerns (layout, phone input overrides, autocomplete panel, errors).

## Problem Breakdown
- Existing code co-locates layout, form field, phone input, and autocomplete styling in monolithic files, which hampers reuse and clarity.
- Need to create a `css/` folder under `src/modules/wizards/client/` that mirrors the project wizard structure and define single-responsibility CSS files (dialog/layout, inputs, phone, autocomplete, feedback, utilities).
- Update TypeScript components to import the new CSS files so styles continue loading; ensure tailwind utility interplay remains intact.
- Confirm there are no additional dependencies on the removed files and adjust any relative paths.
- Maintain cohesion, avoid redundant definitions, and ensure any shared utilities (like `sr-only`) remain available where needed.

## User Request
S1: src/modules/wizards/client/client-wizard.css, src/modules/wizards/client/client-form.css -> separate the css classes based on role and logic into single-scoped files, move all css files into a proper css folder, and finally update all dependencies
Completed: IN REVIEW

## Coding implementation
- Created `src/modules/wizards/client/css/` with scoped styles for dialog layout, form grid, phone input, autocomplete panel, footer feedback, and client input overrides.
- Removed legacy `client-wizard.css` and `client-form.css`, replacing component imports with the new CSS bundle paths in `WizardNewClientDialog.tsx`.

## Notes
- `npm run lint` currently fails with the repository's existing ESLint flat-config migration error (`plugins` declared as array). No project files were altered in response.
