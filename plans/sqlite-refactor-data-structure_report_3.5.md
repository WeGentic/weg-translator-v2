# Step 3.5 Report — Transactional Integrity Validated

- **Scope**: Ensured all multi-table project operations enforce transactional safety per requirements A13 and A20–A23.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Audited the new CRUD helpers in `src-tauri/src/db/operations/projects_v2.rs` to confirm they already leverage pooled transactions for create/update/delete flows.
  - Added rollback-focused unit tests covering project creation, file attachment, and subject updates to guarantee partial writes are reverted on constraint violations or trigger failures.
- **Verification**: `cargo test db::operations::projects_v2 --tests` (run from `src-tauri`) passes, demonstrating the new tests and existing logic behave as expected.
- **Open Items**: None; backend is ready for renderer integration work in Task 4.
