# Step 4.1 Report — Shared Database Types Added

- **Scope**: Established TypeScript counterparts for every entity in the new SQLite schema so renderer code can consume the v2 IPC surface with strong typing (A4, A6–A23).
- **Key Changes**:
  - Created `src/shared/types/database.ts` containing canonical interfaces for users, clients, projects, project/file language pairs, artifacts, jobs, and their associated create/update payloads.
  - Updated existing unit tests to satisfy the expanded `AppSettings` contract, eliminating lingering references to deprecated fields.
- **Verification**: `pnpm typecheck` succeeds, confirming the new types integrate cleanly with the current frontend code.
- **Open Items**: Next step will refactor the IPC wrappers to rely on these shared types (Step 4.2).
