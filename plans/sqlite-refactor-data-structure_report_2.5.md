# Step 2.5 Report — Index Coverage Added

- **Scope**: Implemented the schema indexes mandated by A13, A15, and A18 to support efficient lookups on the new tables.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added `CREATE INDEX` statements for `project_language_pairs(project_uuid)` and `project_files(project_uuid)` to accelerate project-scoped queries.
  - Created artifact indexes: non-unique on `project_uuid` and unique on `(project_uuid, artifact_uuid)` per requirement.
- **Verification**: `cargo check` from `src-tauri` succeeded, confirming compilation with the new index list.
- **Next Phase**: Move into Task 3 (backend operations refactor) unless feedback indicates further adjustments.
