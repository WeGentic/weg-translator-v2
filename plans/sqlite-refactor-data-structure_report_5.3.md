# Step 5.3 Report â€” Legacy Audit Completed

- **Scope**: Final sweep to ensure the repository reflects the new SQLite schema and to document the outcome for the team (A2, A24).
- **Key Changes**:
  - Replaced the pre-refactor catalog with `docs/db-refactor-summary.md`, outlining the v2 schema, IPC surface, and testing runbook.
  - Searched for legacy schema helpers (`rg "insert_project_with_files"`, `rg "project_root_path"`, etc.) and confirmed remaining occurrences live only inside compatibility layers earmarked in the summary for future removal.
- **Verification**: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, targeted Vitest, and `cargo test db_manager_v2 --tests` all pass, giving confidence that no stale references surfaced during cleanup.
- **Open Items**: Follow-up migration to retire `create_project_with_files`/`ProjectService` once the renderer switches entirely to the v2 IPC adapters.
