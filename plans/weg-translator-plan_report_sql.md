# weg-translator-plan Execution Report

## Step 1.1 – Shared UUID handling (Completed 2025-02-14)
- Implemented `resolve_attachment_file_uuid` so `attach_project_file_v2` resolves the target UUID a single time and threads it into both mapper builders.
- Updated `map_new_file_info_args` and `map_new_project_file_args` signatures to accept the resolved UUID, removing duplicate minting.
- Source changes: `src-tauri/src/ipc/commands/projects_v2.rs`.
- Tests: Regression coverage still pending under Step 1.3; no automated tests executed yet.

## Step 1.2 – Role-aware language pair validation (Completed 2025-02-14)
- Added a `requires_language_pairs` guard in `map_new_project_file_args` so only `processable` attachments enforce the non-empty language pair rule; non-processable roles now accept empty vectors.
- No database operation updates were required because `replace_file_language_pairs` already handles zero-row scenarios safely.
- Source changes: `src-tauri/src/ipc/commands/projects_v2.rs`.
- Tests: Regression coverage remains to be added in Step 1.3.
