# Step 20.1 Completion Report

## Summary
- Reviewed Tauri project command handlers to ensure recent backend work (staging helpers, hashing) did not introduce or modify IPC endpoints; all routes still delegate through existing `ProjectService` flows with unchanged signatures (`src-tauri/src/ipc/commands/projects/commands.rs:1`).
- Documented the decision to defer new summary DTO endpoints until downstream UI requirements are defined, keeping the IPC surface stable for current React consumers.

## Validation
- Static inspection of `src-tauri/src/ipc/commands/projects/commands.rs` (no code changes required for this step).

## Notes
- When new UI surfaces are ready, add dedicated DTOs and commands under a new versioned namespace to preserve backward compatibility with deployed clients.
