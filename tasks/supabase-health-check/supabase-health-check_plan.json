If database is unhealthy, we have two options: (1) Block login attempts and show an error message, preventing wasted effort and confusing authentication failures, or (2) Show a warning but allow users to try anyway, which is less restrictive but could lead to frustration if login genuinely fails. The user request asks for an indicator but does not specify blocking behavior. A soft warning approach is generally better UX but requires clear error messaging if subsequent operations fail.",

      "context": "Different monitoring strategies have different tradeoffs. Continuous polling provides reliable status updates but consumes resources and could impact rate limits. Listening to Supabase realtime events is efficient but depends on websocket connectivity. Static display after initial check is simplest but provides stale information if connection drops during session. A reasonable compromise is periodic polling every 2-5 minutes, which balances freshness with resource usage. This decision affects the useSupabaseHealth hook configuration and polling logic.",
