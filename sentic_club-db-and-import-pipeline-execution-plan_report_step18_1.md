# Step 18.1 Completion Report

## Summary
- `ProjectService::create_project_with_files` now seeds project metadata inside a single transaction (`seed_project_metadata`), stages originals under `.staging/`, promotes via atomic rename, and drives lifecycle from `CREATING` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `READY` using dedicated helpers (`src-tauri/src/ipc/commands/projects/service.rs:395`).
- Staging leverages `create_project_staging_dir`, `stage_original_files`, and `promote_staged_project` so COPY_FILE jobs capture success/failure, project files record SHA-256/size, and root paths update only after promotion (`src-tauri/src/ipc/commands/projects/file_operations.rs:280`).
- Default language pairs seed `project_language_pairs`/`file_targets` during creation, ensuring conversion planning has targets immediately after project creation.

## Validation
- `cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

## Notes
- Legacy `create_project_directory` remains available (marked `#[allow(dead_code)]`) for add-files workflows until they migrate to the staging pipeline.
