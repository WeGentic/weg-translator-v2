# Task 2 Documentation — ProjectManagerView Modernisation

Date: 2025-02-15

## Scope
Task 2 delivered a React 19-ready implementation of `ProjectManagerView` under `src/features/project-manager-v2/ProjectManagerView.tsx`, mirroring the legacy behaviour while reducing manual memoisation and consolidating state.

## Summary of Changes
- Ported the legacy view logic into the new `project-manager-v2` module and refactored state management around a consolidated `controls` object (search + filters) while preserving selection, dialog, and sorting state.
- Replaced callback/memo wrappers with inline handlers backed by the React Compiler and introduced a `refreshProjects` helper managed through a `useRef`-driven polling loop.
- Added resilient error handling via `resolveErrorMessage` and retained legacy UX flows for project creation, deletion, and batch actions.
- Documented interaction contracts for toolbar, content, sidebar sync, and IPC flows to guide subsequent tasks.

## Validation
- `npx eslint src/features/project-manager-v2/ProjectManagerView.tsx`

## Risks & Mitigations
- Toolbar/content components still import from the legacy module; Tasks 3–4 will relocate and modernise them. Documentation captures the expected prop shapes to prevent regressions.
- `filterProjects` remains shared with the legacy implementation. Task 5 will determine the long-term home for this selector; no behavioural drift expected meanwhile.

## Hand-off Notes
- Follow Sub-task 2.1–2.3 documentation for detailed rationale on state consolidation, effect management, and interaction parity.
- Update imports to the v2 components once Tasks 3–4 land to remove cross-module references.
