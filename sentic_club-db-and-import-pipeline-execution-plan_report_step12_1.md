# Step 12.1 Completion Report

## Summary
- Added `ProjectService::seed_project_metadata` to stage project creation inside a single DB transaction, inserting the project row (`lifecycle_status='CREATING'`, `owner_user_id=LOCAL_OWNER_USER_ID`), deduped language pairs, staged project files (`storage_state='STAGED'`, `.staging/original/<id>__name.ext` paths), and seed `file_targets` records.
- Extended project/file domain types and insert helpers to carry lifecycle, ownership, role, and storage state metadata; introduced staging path helpers and constants for reusable path generation.

## Validation
- `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
  - Status: âœ… (existing doctest failures still pending from earlier steps; unit compilation succeeds).

## Notes
- The new seeding API currently surfaces staged file/language metadata for future filesystem work; callers still use the legacy flow until Step 12.2 integrates staging copy + promotion.
