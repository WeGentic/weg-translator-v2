# Task 5 Documentation — Cross-cutting Updates & Shared Assets

Date: 2025-02-17

## Scope
Completed Task 5 by aligning project manager v2 shared types, filtering utilities, and UI affordances with React 19 expectations while preserving legacy behaviour.

## Summary
- Finalised immutable filter typings and helper APIs (`TableFiltersPatch`, `createDefaultTableControlsState`) so downstream components share a single source of truth without touching the legacy module.
- Localised the `filterProjects` selector under `project-manager-v2/utils` with typed thresholds and consistent search coverage; updated consumers accordingly.
- Closed the accessibility audit with minor UI tweaks (`group` hover container, `aria-selected`), ensuring parity with palette and screen-reader expectations.

## Validation
- Spot-checked lint against the updated v2 files via `pnpm exec eslint ...` (no new violations).
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` still fails because of long-standing issues in other packages; none originate from Task 5 changes.

## Follow-ups
1. Task 6 — use the stabilised helpers to define Vitest/Testing Library coverage for filtering, selection, and dialog flows.
2. Revisit global lint/tsconfig debt surfaced during checks once broader modernisation reaches those packages.
