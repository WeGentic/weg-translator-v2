# wizard-files-step-redesign

## Current User Request Analysis
- Redesign WizardFilesStep dropzone to improve hierarchy, adopt single-column layout, and emphasize taller drop area per user request.
- Existing component couples copy, button, and hint inside responsive row layout with numerous utility classes; CSS lives in wizard-v2.css with complex gradients, currently optimized for horizontal arrangement.

## Problem Breakdown
- Current styling assumes multi-column flex row at >=640px; requires refactor to true single-column stack and height emphasis without breaking table section.
- Implementation touches React component (WizardFilesStep.tsx) and shared wizard-v2 CSS; needs coordination to keep class naming consistent and avoid regressions.
- Must adapt event handlers & semantics while keeping drag/drop logic intact; ensure React 19 guidelines (compiler friendliness, no unnecessary memoization) remain satisfied.
- Challenges: balancing dense existing visual theme with clearer hierarchy, ensuring accessible focus states, verifying dropzone height responsiveness, and validating that table layout remains unaffected.
- Maintainability goal: encapsulate dropzone structure with clear sub-elements, keep CSS scoped via existing wizard-v2 naming, and avoid introducing new abstractions unless required.

## User Request
S1: Redesign the WizardFilesStep dropzone for better drag-and-drop zone, clearer hierarchy, single-column layout, and higher height-to-width ratio.
Completed: COMPLETED

## Coding implementation
- Reworked `WizardFilesStep` dropzone markup to a stacked column layout with clear hierarchy, keeping drag/drop handlers intact.
- Added new supportive copy and action area, ensuring accessible semantics and focusability per React 19 patterns.
- Refined `wizard-v2.css` dropzone styles: centered single-column layout with responsive `clamp` height, tuned padding, and compact icon treatment.
- Follow-up iteration reduced vertical footprint and simplified copy per user feedback.
- Verified `WizardFilesStep.tsx` passes ESLint via `npm exec -- eslint src/modules/projects/components/wizard-v2/components/WizardFilesStep.tsx`.

## Notes
- Unable to locate docs/react19-guidelines.md in repository; will follow general React 19 compiler guidance from project context and existing patterns.
- Additional research gathered via external React drag-and-drop UI best practices (accessibility, copy clarity, feedback).
