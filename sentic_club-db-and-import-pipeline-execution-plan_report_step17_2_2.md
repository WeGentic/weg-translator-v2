# Step 17.2.2 Completion Report

## Summary
- Introduced `DbManager::bridge_file_target_from_conversion` to derive language pairs, file targets, and artifacts directly from legacy `project_file_conversions` rows with idempotent upserts and status escalation.
- Added `DbManager::bridge_project_conversions` to batch-process all conversions for a project, simplifying future backfill and service-layer adoption.
- Enhanced bridging to capture outcomes (created pair/target, updated status, generated artifact ids) via the new `FileTargetBridgeOutcome` type.

## Validation
- `cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

## Notes
- Artifact upserts intentionally reuse `ArtifactStatus::Generated` and defer checksum/size population until the staging pipeline provides metadata.
