# Step 22.3 Completion Report

## Summary
- Introduced `src-tauri/tests/conversion_plan.rs` with two integration tests covering conversion planning and artifact persistence flows:
  - `build_conversions_plan_generates_expected_tasks` seeds a project/file in a sandboxed workspace, pre-creates the associated file target, and asserts the plan output includes projected input/output paths alongside artifact directory scaffolding.
  - `artifact_upsert_updates_existing_record` ensures `upsert_artifact_row` overwrites existing rows (path, checksum, status) rather than duplicating entries for the same file target.
- Tests rely on scoped temporary directories inside `target/tmp-tests` to avoid OS temp sandbox quirks and run the full migration stack via `sqlx::migrate!`.

## Validation
- `cargo test --test conversion_plan --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `cargo test --lib --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

## Notes
- File target rows are inserted directly via SQL to bypass the legacy conversion-bridging path and keep the assertions focused on planning output and artifact upsert behaviour.
