# Task 10.2 Documentation

## Summary
- Added a release notes section to `README.md` covering the domain-first refactor, alias expectations, relocated tests, ShadCN generator changes, and key developer follow-up actions.
- Logged ticket-ready backlog entries (theme extraction, OpenXLIFF wizard polish, workspace telemetry, navigation hook relocation) inside `docs/domain-refactor-journal.md` for transparent handoff.
- Updated `sentic_club-domain-first-refactor-plan.md` to mark Task 10 complete and capture the peer review talking points.

## Verification
- Tests not re-run; documentation-only changes.

## Follow-ups
- File tracker tickets for the four backlog entries noted in `docs/domain-refactor-journal.md` and confirm ownership alignment during the next sprint planning session.
