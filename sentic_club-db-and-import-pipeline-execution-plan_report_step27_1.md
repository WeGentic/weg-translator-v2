# Step 27.1 Documentation Report

## Summary
- Produced updated documentation describing the new database pipeline architecture, staging safety, and recovery tooling so engineers have a single reference after the schema rollout.

## Implementation Details
- Captured schema checkpoints, staging lifecycle, path policies, and the CLI-based recovery flow in `docs/db-pipeline-backfill-documentation.md`, citing the relevant migrations and Rust helpers.
- Called out the newly added backfill helpers (`backfill_file_targets_from_legacy`, `backfill_artifacts_from_disk`) and the `backfill-legacy-data` CLI so operators know how to reconcile legacy installs.
- Highlighted path safety guards and checksum validation to reinforce current hardening work.

## Testing
- Documentation-only change (no automated tests required).
