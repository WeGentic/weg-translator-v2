# Step 22.2 Completion Report

## Summary
- Implemented `test_staging_copy_and_promotion_flow` under `src-tauri/src/ipc/commands/projects/file_operations.rs`, covering the full staging lifecycle: directory preparation via `SettingsManager`, streaming copy into `.staging` with SHA-256 verification, and atomic promotion into the final project directory.
- The test asserts that checksum metadata matches RustCrypto's expected digest, the staged artifact lands under `original/`, and the temporary `.staging` placeholder is removed post-promotionâ€”ensuring behaviour holds across macOS/Windows CI targets.

## Validation
- `cargo test --lib --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

## Notes
- Uses `tempfile::tempdir()` to provide isolated filesystem roots so rename semantics are exercised on the same volume, mirroring desktop deployment conditions without mutating the developer environment.
