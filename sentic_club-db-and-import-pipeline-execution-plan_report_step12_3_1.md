# Step 12.3.1 Completion Report

## Summary
- Added `promote_staging_directory` with rollback-aware directory renames to lift `{uuid}-{slug}.staging` into the final project layout, including promotion of `.staging/original` and `.staging/artifacts` and cleanup of the temporary scaffold (`src-tauri/src/ipc/commands/projects/file_operations.rs`).
- Introduced `revert_promoted_directory` plus `ProjectService::promote_staged_project` to coordinate filesystem promotion, update staged file metadata, refresh root paths, and transition lifecycle status to `READY` with error recovery (`src-tauri/src/ipc/commands/projects/service.rs`).
- Extended DB ops with `finalize_staged_project_files` and `update_project_root_path` to strip `.staging/` prefixes, flip storage states to `COPIED`, and persist the final project root (`src-tauri/src/db/operations/project_files.rs`, `src-tauri/src/db/operations/projects.rs`).

## Validation
- `cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` *(passes; only longstanding warnings about unused exports remain).*

## Notes
- Atomic rename and fallback strategy reference current Rust 1.90 filesystem guidance: `std::fs::rename` semantics for same-volume atomic moves and staged directory promotion patterns [Rust std::fs::rename](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/fn.rename.html) [tempfile crate docs](https://docs.rs/tempfile/).
