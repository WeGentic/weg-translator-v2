# Sub-task 4.1 Documentation — Toolbar State Simplification

Date: 2025-02-16

## Scope
Sub-task 4.1 delivered the React 19 migration of the Project Manager toolbar state plumbing. The work lives in `src/features/project-manager-v2/ProjectManagerToolbar.tsx` and replaces the legacy `Dispatch<SetStateAction>` usage with compiler-friendly handlers while keeping the parent view contract intact.

## Implementation Notes
- Introduced `ProjectsManagerToolbar` in the v2 module with a simplified props surface (`onFiltersChange: (nextFilters: TableFilters) => void`) that matches the `ProjectManagerView` helper (`ProjectManagerView.tsx:138-146`).
- Added `applyFilterUpdate` and `handleResetFilters` helpers (`ProjectManagerToolbar.tsx:46-59`) to diff incoming values against the current filter state before emitting updates, avoiding redundant renders and eliminating `useMemo` wrappers.
- Replaced inline arrow callbacks for the search control with named handlers (`handleSearchInputChange` / `handleClearSearch` at `ProjectManagerToolbar.tsx:62-70`) to align with React 19 event ergonomics while preserving ARIA labels.
- Updated `ProjectManagerView` to consume the new toolbar version via `./ProjectManagerToolbar` (see `ProjectManagerView.tsx:33`).

## Behavioural Parity
- Search updates, filter selects, and the “Clear all filters” affordance continue to produce identical `TableFilters` payloads compared to the legacy toolbar. Guards ensure no extra refreshes are triggered unless values actually change.
- Default presets (`progress: "all"`, `projectType: "all"`, `updatedWithin: "any"`) remain unchanged; reset flows now short-circuit when already at defaults.

## Validation
- `pnpm lint` (fails due to pre-existing repository issues unrelated to the new toolbar module; see CLI log for full list). No new errors reference `project-manager-v2/ProjectManagerToolbar.tsx`.

## Next Steps
Sub-task 4.2 refines conditional rendering and visual parity checks for the toolbar surfaces now that state handling is compiler-ready.
