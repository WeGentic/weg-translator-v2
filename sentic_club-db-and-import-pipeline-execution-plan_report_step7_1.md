# Step 7.1 Completion Report

## Summary
- Added `src-tauri/migrations/015_create_validations.sql` to create the `validations` table with cascaded FK to `artifacts`, boolean `passed` enforced via CHECK, optional JSON payload column, and UTC timestamp default.

## Validation
- Migration tests pending (Task 22); not executed yet.

## Notes
- JSON payload stored as TEXT; integrity validation will occur at the service layer using SQLite JSON1 helpers as documented in [SQLite JSON1](https://sqlite.org/json1.html) and [Beekeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/blog/sqlite-json).
