# Sub-task 3.3 Documentation â€” Rendering Parity & QA Notes

Date: 2025-02-15

## Scope
Sub-task 3.3 confirmed that the v2 table renders identically to the legacy experience across desktop/mobile breakpoints, including empty states, selection feedback, and footer chips.

## Verification Activities
- Manual smoke testing in the development build: confirmed search-driven empty state messaging (`ProjectsTableGrid`) and footer counters respond to selection mutations from the grid.
- Checked responsive breakpoints via `useBreakpoint` by forcing viewport toggles; column visibility matches the legacy priorities (updated column hides first).
- Validated batch-selection flows: header checkbox selects the filtered `items`, row-level checkboxes fire the same `Set<string>` semantics consumed by `useSidebarTwoContentSync`.

## Residual Risks
- No automated visual regression exists yet; capture remains a follow-up item for Task 6. Manual verification should remain part of the QA checklist.

## Validation
- ESLint suite for all touched files (see Sub-task 3.2 documentation) returned clean.

## Next Steps
Aggregate overall findings for Task 3 and update the project milestone plan.
