# Core IPC Migration Summary

## Scope
- Completed Task 3 / Sub-task 3.1 from the tr-entic domain-first refactor plan by relocating the IPC layer into `src/core`.

## Changes
- Migrated `client.ts`, `events.ts`, and `types.ts` into `src/core/ipc` with a consolidated barrel export and removed the legacy `src/ipc` directory.
- Lifted shared IPC helpers (`openxliff`, `fs`, and `jliff` adapters) from `src/lib` into the new `src/core/ipc` namespace and re-exported them for consumers.
- Updated application and test imports to use `@/core/ipc`, ensuring the plan file reflects the completed step.

## Validation
- `npx tsc --noEmit` *(fails due to pre-existing type errors in workspace packages; no new IPC-specific errors observed prior to failure)*.

## Follow-up
- Proceed with Task 3 Sub-task 3.2 to relocate logging/configuration into `src/core`.
