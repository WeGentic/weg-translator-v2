# Task 9 - Cleanup & Consistency Summary

## Scope
- Fulfilled Task 9 of the domain-first refactor plan covering structural cleanup and developer enablement documentation.
- Finalized Sub-task 9.1 (legacy folder retirement, import sweeps, alias updates) and Sub-task 9.2 (architecture doc refresh + migration notes).

## Key Actions
- Relocated `AppErrorBoundary` into `src/app/providers/errors`, moved the logging console to `src/shared/logging`, and migrated project file format constants to `src/modules/projects/config`.
- Removed empty legacy directories (`src/components`, `src/features`, `src/hooks`, `src/lib`, `src/styles`) after confirming all consumers point at the new modules.
- Updated imports to use `@/modules/projects/config`, excised the `@/components/ui` compatibility alias from TypeScript/Vite configs, and refreshed `components.json` alias mapping for ShadCN scaffolding.
- Revised `README.md` sections that describe repository layout and frontend components so they align with the `src/app`/`src/core`/`src/modules`/`src/shared` architecture.
- Logged a 2025-03-01 entry in `docs/domain-refactor-journal.md` documenting alias cleanup, generator updates, and the new import locations to guide ongoing PR reviews.

## Validation
- Ran targeted `rg` sweeps to ensure no runtime code references `@/features`, `@/components`, or `@/lib/file-formats` remain.
- Verified TypeScript/Vite configs compile without the deprecated alias entries; no build/test commands executed yet (scheduled under Task 10).

## Follow-up / Risks
- Downstream branches relying on `@/components/ui` must rebase and adopt `@/shared/ui` before merging.
- Workspace footer still uses a logger placeholder; integrating `src/shared/logging/LogConsole.tsx` is a future enhancement once layout tweaks stabilize.
- Continue monitoring for documentation or scripts that may still reference deleted directories and update them opportunistically.
