# Sub-task 5.1 Documentation

## Summary
- Moved the former layout suite into `src/app/shell`, preserving component composition (`MainLayout`, shell slots) and keeping the public API through an updated barrel export.
- Updated TanStack router root, legacy `App.tsx`, tests, and workspace utilities to import from the new shell namespace.
- Ensured shell components reference shared Tailwind layers (`@/shared/styles/layout/**`, `@/shared/styles/theme|motion.css`) to keep styling centralized.

## Verification
- Searched for `@/app/layout` to confirm all imports now point at `@/app/shell`.
- Manually exercised MainLayout usage in `src/routes/__root.tsx` and `src/test/...` modules by verifying TypeScript imports resolve locally (no automated run in this slice).

## Follow Ups
- Continue with Sub-task 5.2 to relocate providers (`AuthContext`, logging) into the new `src/app/providers` namespace.
- Plan to rename tests under `src/test/app/layout` once provider/state reorganization lands, to mirror the updated shell folder structure.
