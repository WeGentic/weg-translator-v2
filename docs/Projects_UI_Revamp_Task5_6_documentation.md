# Projects UI Revamp — Task 5 & 6 Documentation (Polish + Testing)

## Task 5 — Visual & Accessibility Polish
- Status badges: unified StatusBadge; progress badges (Pending/Running/Completed/Failed) with appropriate tones.
- Metadata cues: file count displayed as a compact chip; updated uses relative time with full tooltip.
- Interaction states: subtle row hover; focus-visible rings on sortable headers and action buttons.
- Accessibility: `aria-sort` on headers; icon actions have `aria-label`; tooltips do not trap focus.
- Micro-interactions: gentle transitions on hover; reduced density for readability.

## Task 6 — Quality Assurance & Testing
- Unit tests:
  - Date formatting parts via `formatDateParts`: src/test/lib/datetime.test.ts
- Component tests:
  - ProjectsDataTable filter + actions: src/test/components/projects/table/ProjectsDataTable.test.tsx

## Notes
- Header remains non-sticky per feedback to keep spacing; row hover maintained.
- Backend aggregation adds `activityStatus` (pending/running/completed/failed) to ProjectListItem.

## Next
- Consider adding a quick filter chip row for active filters and a compact column visibility menu.
- Performance pass on large datasets (150–200 rows) and documenting results (Plan Step 6.5).
