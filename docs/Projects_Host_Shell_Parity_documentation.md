# Projects Host Shell Parity Summary

## Overview
- Delivered reusable `ProjectsHostShell` component under `packages/layout-projects-host/`, mirroring the Projects table host DOM and styling.
- Replaced ThreeZonePanel usage in dashboard, resources, settings, and editor surfaces with the new host for consistent chrome and footer handling.
- Ensured structural CSS and dropdown overrides are shared by importing existing `dropdowns.css` within the package stylesheet.

## Page & Component Updates
- Dashboard/resources routes now wrap the host with `div.flex min-h-0 flex-1 flex-col px-2 pb-4 md:px-4` so the panel inherits the same gutters/clearance as Projects, and both use lightweight mock cards/filters purely to demonstrate shell parity (no extra sticky wrappers or multiline headers).
- `WorkspacePage` now renders those same preview components when `mainView === "dashboard"` or `"resource"`, replacing the legacy fallback so sidebar navigation shows the new shell-aligned placeholders.
- `EnhancedAppSettingsPanel` and `EditorPanel` adopt the host shell, keeping existing toolbar/header components and adding section wrappers for layout parity.
- Added rollback guidance comments near host imports to simplify reverting to `ThreeZonePanel` if verification uncovers regressions.

## Testing & Tooling
- Added `ProjectsHostShell.test.tsx` covering prop/slot rendering, overflow handling, and inline DOM snapshot parity.
- Updated `src/test/routes/panels.test.tsx` to assert host shell presence across dashboard/resources/settings/editor flows.
- Executed targeted Vitest suites (`npm run test -- packages/layout-projects-host/src/ProjectsHostShell.test.tsx src/test/routes/panels.test.tsx`).
- Ran `npm run lint`; new files pass lint. Command continues to flag pre-existing issues in legacy layout/tests (see lint log from run on 2025-02-14 for details).

## Follow-Up Notes
- Reverting to the previous layout only requires swapping imports back to `@wegentic/layout-three-zone` thanks to inline rollback comments.
- Repository still has outstanding ESLint violations unrelated to this work (e.g., `src/components/projects/...`, `src/test/components/...`). Address separately if lint gate is tightened.
