# History Module Migration Summary

## Scope
- Moved translation history UI (`HistoryToolbar`, `TranslationHistoryTable`) and state hook (`useTranslationHistory`) into the new `src/modules/history` module.
- Created module barrel exports for ui, hooks, and types while removing the legacy `src/components/history` directory.

## Integration Notes
- Existing IPC adapters from `@/core/ipc` remain the source of data; the hook now lives alongside the UI consumers.
- Test suite continues to exercise `TranslationHistoryTable` via the module entrypoint to validate the refactor.

## Follow-ups
- Build dedicated history route/screens once workspace wiring is ready.
- Co-locate history-specific tests under `src/modules/history/__tests__` during Task 8 execution.
