# Task 9 â€“ Theming, Tokens, and Styles

## Overview
- Audited `src/App.css` to confirm the full WeGentic palette (light/dark) plus Tailwind 4 `@theme inline` mappings are available, keeping utility colors in sync with brand tokens.
- Harmonized ShadCN focus treatments so primary inputs/buttons/textarea consume the palette-driven ring/ring-offset variables.

## Implementation Notes
- Buttons now rely on `focus-visible:ring-ring` and `ring-offset-background` rather than custom border overrides (`src/components/ui/button.tsx`).
- Inputs and textareas received the same focus treatment, retaining accessible outlines while ensuring ring colors pull from the token set (`src/components/ui/input.tsx`, `src/components/ui/textarea.tsx`).

## Follow-up Suggestions
- Extend the focus-ring pattern to any remaining custom controls (e.g., file pickers or future bespoke components).
- Revisit dark-mode palette once final QA assets arrive to tune contrast ratios for success/destructive accents.
