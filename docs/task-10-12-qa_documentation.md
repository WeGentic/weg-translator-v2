# Task 10–12 QA Completion

## Scope
- Finalized Task 10 smoke tests and visual parity checks for Dashboard, Resources, Settings, and Editor panels.
- Closed Task 11.2 by auditing state usage to ensure no uncontrolled polling or jitter was introduced.
- Completed Task 12 rollout validation and recorded the migration checklist for Settings and Editor.

## Changes
- Extended `src/test/routes/panels.test.tsx` with keyboard navigation assertions for all three-zone panels.
- Added styling regression coverage to confirm the rendered ThreeZonePanel retains baseline chrome classes.
- Updated `docs/Plan_Sentic_Club_Three-Zone_Layout.md` statuses and notes for Tasks 10–12.

## Verification
- `npm run test -- src/test/routes/panels.test.tsx`

## Follow-ups
- Monitor upcoming data-loading integrations to decide if additional polling simulations are required in panel tests.

## Feedback
- Please review the expanded smoke tests and checklist and let me know if further scenarios should be captured.
