# Sub-task 4.1 â€“ Centralize UI Primitives And Themes

## Completed scope
- Promoted `IconTooltipButton` into `src/shared/icons`, ensuring the shared namespace houses reusable icon controls.
- Added a barrel file for shared icons and retargeted all project manager and project overview imports to the new shared entry point.
- Refreshed supporting planning docs to reflect the shared-path migration.

## Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` *(fails on pre-existing errors in workspace packages and legacy project-manager paths; no new errors introduced by the icon migration).* 

## Follow-up notes
- Future typography and form abstractions can reuse the new `src/shared/icons` structure when they are extracted.
- Remaining tasks in Task 4 continue with hooks/utilities and shared style consolidation.
