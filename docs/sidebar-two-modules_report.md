# Sidebar Two Module â€“ Implementation Report

## Completed Tasks
- Stage 1: Revisited sidebar module architecture, registry behaviours, and existing project focus utilities to ground the new feature requirements.
- Stage 2: Established a four-part task list covering module design, component implementation, registration, and testing.
- Stage 3: Audited the workspace/project navigation flow, confirming `dispatchProjectFocus` and `FocusedProjectShortcut` can supply the sidebar tab UX and identifying the need to react to `PROJECT_CLEAR_EVENT`.
- Stage 4: Selected an event-scoped, persistent module triggered by `PROJECT_FOCUS_EVENT`, reusing `FocusedProjectShortcut`, and outlined navigation/dismissal expectations (TanStack Router navigation + `dispatchProjectClear`).
- Stage 5: Captured risks around duplicate activations, stale payload cleanup, and safe navigation when closing the tab.
- Stage 7: Implemented `ProjectFocusSidebarModule` with persistent registry definition, navigation and dismissal callbacks, and added it to the project sidebar registration pipeline.
- Stage 8: Authored Vitest coverage validating trigger mapping, navigation, dismissal, and event-driven cleanup; executed the suite successfully (`pnpm vitest run src/modules/project-manager/sidebar/__tests__/projectFocusModule.test.tsx`).
- Stage 9: Refined sidebar header behaviour and lowered project tab priority so route content stays visually first while focus events stop overwriting titles with project-specific labels.
- Stage 10: Implemented sidebar module prioritisation that sorts route-activated panels before manual/event ones, ensuring the persistent project tab anchors beneath whichever view-specific modules are active.

## Next Steps
- Monitor integration with real navigation flows to ensure additional project close surfaces emit `dispatchProjectClear` when appropriate and continue visual QA for the refreshed header/tab presentation.
