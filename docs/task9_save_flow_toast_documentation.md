# Task 9.D.3 â€” Save Flow Toast Integration (2025-09-24)

## Scope
- Finished Step 9.D.3 by introducing a shared toast layer and emitting notifications from the segment save workflow.
- Ensured the editor retains inline feedback while adding ambient success/error cues consistent with the QC UX plan.

## Key Changes
- Added `ToastProvider` infrastructure under `src/components/ui/toast.tsx` with a lightweight portal-based viewport and `useToast` hook re-export.
- Wrapped the application shell in `ToastProvider` (`src/main.tsx`) so any workspace component can raise notifications.
- Updated `TargetEditor` to call `toast()` for save success and failure while keeping inline alerts for contextual messaging (`src/components/projects/editor/TargetEditor.tsx`).
- Adjusted editor tests to mount inside the toast provider to validate the new dependency (`src/components/projects/editor/ProjectEditor.test.tsx`).

## Validation
- `npm run test:run -- ProjectEditor`

## Follow-up
- Consider consolidating toast styling tokens with design system colors once global theme reviews land (Task 21).
- Monitor for duplicate notifications when bulk-saving segments or triggering multiple actions in quick succession.
