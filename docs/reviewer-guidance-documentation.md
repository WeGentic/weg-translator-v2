# Reviewer Guidance Documentation

## Completed Work
- Established `docs/domain-refactor-journal.md` as a living log to guide reviewers through alias adoption, theme consolidation, and module migrations.
- Seeded the journal with an initial checklist and dated entry capturing today's alias and theme-planning changes so incremental PRs have immediate review anchors.

## Verification
- Linked the new journal inside the master plan (Task 9.2.2) to keep documentation tasks synchronized with engineering progress.

## Follow-Ups
- Continue adding dated entries as each module migrates or new tooling changes land, keeping reviewers aware of evolving expectations.
