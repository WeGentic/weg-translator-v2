# Shared UI Migration Summary

## Scope
- Advanced Task 4 / Sub-task 4.1 by relocating the ShadCN UI primitives from `src/components/ui` into the shared layer and exposing a centralized barrel export.

## Changes
- Moved all base primitives (buttons, cards, dialog, toast, DropZone, etc.) into `src/shared/ui`, preserving component APIs and theme bindings.
- Created `src/shared/ui/index.ts` to re-export primitives and hooks, enabling future imports from `@/shared/ui` without deep paths.
- Added compatibility aliases in Vite/TypeScript (`@/components/ui/*` â†’ `src/shared/ui`) so legacy paths served by tooling no longer trigger 404s while the migration completes.
- Updated application and test imports to reference the shared namespace, ensuring consistency ahead of remaining shared-resource migrations.

## Validation
- `npx tsc --noEmit` *(fails: existing workspace/type issues unrelated to the UI relocation; no new errors surfaced before prior failures).* 

## Follow-up
- Complete Step 4.1.2 by consolidating typography, iconography, and higher-order UI wrappers into the shared layer.
- Revisit typecheck failures after broader domain moves settle to confirm shared UI stability.
