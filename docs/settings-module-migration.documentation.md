# Settings Module Migration Summary

## Scope
- Moved settings panels and shared UI primitives into `src/modules/settings/ui` and added a barrel exporter for consumers.
- Updated application shells and Vitest suites to reference the module path, removing dependencies on `src/components/settings`.

## Integration Notes
- IPC calls remain sourced from `@/core/ipc`; the panels continue to read and update configuration through those adapters.
- Existing mocks were repointed to `@/modules/settings` to prevent test regressions during the relocation.

## Follow-ups
- Evaluate splitting large `EnhancedAppSettingsPanel` into focused sub-views once domain workflows are defined.
- Rehome settings-related tests under `src/modules/settings/__tests__` during Task 8.
