# Subtask 5.1 Suspense Fallbacks & Sidebar Coverage (2025-02-20)

## Summary
- Added `ProjectManagerShell.test.tsx` to verify the new Suspense-aware shell renders the `ProjectsSkeleton` fallback when the projects resource suspends.
- Exercised the shared selection store end-to-end: selecting rows updates toolbar metrics, surfaces the batch sidebar, and clears correctly after invoking the mocked delete action.
- Confirmed toolbar "Clear" plumbing resets selection state without triggering extraneous renders, guarding against regressions as Task 3/4 continue.

## Observations
- The tests rely on lightweight module mocks for `useProjectsResource` and batch actions; these can be extended to cover error boundaries or refresh flows once additional behaviours ship.
- `ProjectsBatchActionsPanel` now exposes richer selection summaries (counts, status distribution), providing observable hooks for future analytics assertions.

## Next Steps
1. Extend UI tests to cover multi-select scenarios once TanStack table integration (Step 3.2.3) lands.
2. Add coverage for sidebar metric badges once Task 4.1 introduces additional presenters.
3. Explore integration-style tests that exercise the real projects resource cache for confidence around event-driven refreshes.
