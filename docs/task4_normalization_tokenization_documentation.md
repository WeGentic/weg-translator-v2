# Task 4 â€“ Normalization & Tokenization Utilities Summary

- Completed: 2025-02-14
- Added `src/lib/jliff/tokenize.ts` exposing `mkSegmentKey`, `tokenizeText`, `composeTokenCacheKey`, and placeholder parsing with memoized caching keyed by segment+variant+version+text.
- Implemented `normalizeJliffArtifacts` in `src/lib/jliff/normalize.ts` to join JLIFF transunits with tag-map metadata, emit `SegmentRow` view models, and capture QC diagnostics for placeholder parity, unknown tokens, and order mismatches.
- Extended `SegmentRow` schema (`src/lib/jliff/types.ts`) with `SegmentIssues` to surface parity diagnostics alongside counts.
- Added Vitest coverage (`src/lib/jliff/tokenize.test.ts`, `src/lib/jliff/normalize.test.ts`) verifying tokenization, caching, parity detection, and orphan transunit handling.

Next steps: tackle Task 5 IPC read/write commands to deliver artifact loading and persistence for the editor workflow.
