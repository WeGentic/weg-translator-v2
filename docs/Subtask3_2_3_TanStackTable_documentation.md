# Step 3.2.3 â€“ Controlled TanStack Table Integration (2025-02-21)

## Summary
- Swapped the bespoke project list markup for a TanStack-powered table wired through a new `table` module that exports static column meta and a shared `useProjectsTable` hook.
- Centralized row/header selection inside the project manager store so toolbar metrics, batch sidebar actions, and the table stay in sync without local `Set` bookkeeping.
- Preserved ShadCN styling by mapping alignment and width metadata through column definitions instead of embedding layout classes inline.

## Implementation Notes
- Added `table/columns.tsx`, `table/useProjectsTable.ts`, and an index barrel to expose reusable configuration for other surfaces.
- Updated `ProjectManagerContent` to render TanStack header/cell groups while sourcing project actions (open/delete) from table meta handlers.
- Extended the plan file to log completion of Steps 3.2.3 and 4.2.1, covering controlled selection and column architecture milestones.

## Testing
- `npm run test -- --run src/test/features/project-manager-v2/shell/ProjectManagerShell.test.tsx`
  - Verifies single-row selection, multi-select with header toggles, and retry behaviour for the projects error boundary.

## Follow-ups
- Finish Step 3.1.3 by extracting remaining static config (sorting presets) for the compiler.
- Complete Step 4.2.3 to audit badge/icon styling against the WeGentic palette tokens.
