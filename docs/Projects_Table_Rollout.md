# Projects Table Rollout & Communication

- Enablement
  - Immediate enablement: replaces legacy table; non-breaking and feature-complete.
  - Feature flag optional if you want staged rollout.
- QA Communication
  - Share QA checklist (docs/Projects_Table_QA_Checklist.md) and performance guide.
  - Provide seed data for varied status coverage (pending, running, completed, failed).
- Training
  - Short walkthrough: search, filters, actions, refresh, empty state CTA.
- Monitoring
  - Collect feedback on spacing, density, and filter defaults; adjust per user preference.
