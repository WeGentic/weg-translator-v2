# Task 1 â€“ Repository & Integration Scan Summary

- Completed: 2025-02-14
- Verified frontend stack uses `react@19.1.1`, `tailwindcss@4.1.13`, and Tauri packages at 2.8.x; ShadCN components live under `src/components/ui/` with table primitives available.
- Confirmed `ProjectEditor` translation canvas section is the target mount point for the upcoming virtualized `SegmentsTable`.
- Reviewed backend conversion flow: `convert_xliff_to_jliff` stores artifacts in per-project `jliff/` folders and records `jliff_rel_path` / `tag_map_rel_path` via `DbManager`.
- Current IPC surface lacks read/write commands for JLIFF artifacts, validating the need for planned additions.
- Testing baseline established: Vitest suites under `src/components/**/*.test.tsx`; Rust integration tests reside in `src-tauri/tests/`.

Next steps: proceed with Task 2 dependency setup and utility scaffolding per the execution plan.
