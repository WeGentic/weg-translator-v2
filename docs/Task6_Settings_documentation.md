# Task 6 â€“ Settings Panel Refactor

## Overview
- Converted `src/components/settings/EnhancedAppSettingsPanel.tsx` to use the shared `ThreeZonePanel`, aligning header, toolbar, content, and footer with the three-zone architecture.
- Removed the legacy padding wrapper in `src/features/workspace/WorkspacePage.tsx` so the settings view occupies the layout column cleanly.
- Added toolbar search/filter placeholders plus header Reset/Save actions to mirror the other panels.

## Behavior & Implementation Notes
- All existing IPC-driven update flows stay intact; async handlers now use explicit `void` guards to satisfy strict linting and preserve auto-save semantics.
- The panel footer communicates auto-save status and updates its copy based on `isUpdating` state.
- Toolbar includes a category `Select` bound to the active tab and a search input ready for future filtering logic.

## Outstanding Items
- Step 6.2.2 test coverage is still open; add a smoke test verifying panel rendering once IPC mocks are stabilized.
