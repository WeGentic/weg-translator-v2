# Sub-task 4.1 – Sidebar Synchronization Modernization (2025-02-22)

## Summary
- Modernized the secondary sidebar sync hook to operate on the v2 store selectors, providing deterministic layout mounting and teardown under Suspense.
- Rebuilt batch actions and overview presenters with WeGentic palette tokens, React 19 focus semantics, and direct project navigation affordances.
- Ensured the Project Manager shell coordinates sidebar visibility with optimistic deletion flows, preventing stale selection state after mutations.

## Implementation Notes
- `useSidebarContentSync` now proxies through `useSidebarController`, keeping sidebar two mounted/visible while streaming store-driven content for both selection and overview states.
- `ProjectsBatchActionsPanel` accepts `ProjectListItem` callbacks, adds guarded destructive triggers, and surfaces the first six selections as keyboard-activatable buttons with proper aria labelling.
- Table/grid styling (`ProjectManagerContent`, `table/columns.tsx`) received palette-aligned backgrounds, text colors, and row-state classes to satisfy Step 4.2.3 theming requirements.
- `ProjectManagerShell` memoizes `handleOpenProject` and forwards it to both table rows and the sidebar, closing the loop between list interactions and the newly clickable batch panel.

## Testing
- `npm run test -- --run src/test/features/project-manager-v2/shell/ProjectManagerShell.test.tsx`
  - Verifies single/multi-select flows, toolbar rollbacks, sidebar overview rendering, error-boundary retries, and the new "Open project" action from the batch panel.
  - Logs expected `Gateway timeout` stack traces during the error-boundary scenario (handled by mocks) and Tauri logger warnings when the plugin API is stubbed in Vitest.

## Follow-ups
- Step 5.1.3 (end-to-end rollout checklist) remains open; coordinate with QA once the wizard/sidebar handoff is bundled.
- Monitor UX feedback on the new clickable project list—consider adding hover previews or secondary actions if requested.
