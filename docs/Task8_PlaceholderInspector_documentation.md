# Task 8 â€” Placeholder Inspector Integration (2025-09-23)

## Scope
- Implemented the remaining portion of Task 8 by adding an accessible placeholder inspector detail pane beneath each segment row.
- Integrated the inspector with the virtualized TanStack table, including expand/collapse controls and compatibility with existing token rendering.

## Key Changes
- Added `PlaceholderInspector` component to surface placeholder chips, attribute metadata, original data snapshots, and QC warnings.
- Updated `SegmentsTable` to support expandable detail rows within the virtualized list, including accessible toggle controls and synchronized layout.
- Wired expanded rows to reuse ShadCN primitives and maintain virtualization performance by measuring dynamic row heights.
- Ran `npm run lint`; existing warnings unrelated to this task persist in other editor files.

## Validation
- `npm run lint`
  - Reports pre-existing warnings in `ProjectEditor.tsx` and `ProjectOverview.test.tsx`.
  - `SegmentsTable.tsx` and the new inspector component pass without additional warnings.

## Follow-up
- Next milestones (Task 9 onward) remain pending: target editing actions, save flow IPC, and advanced filters.
- Consider addressing the existing lint warnings in `ProjectEditor.tsx` during Task 13 integration work.
