# Task 12 Documentation â€” Incremental Compatibility Checks

## Scope
- Keep the legacy `App.tsx` available for rollback while routing through the new workspace page.
- Ensure workspace features (project tabs, editor navigation, dynamic header title) operate with the shared layout.
- Verify layout spacing mirrors the previous implementation.

## Key Changes
- `src/routes/index.tsx`
  - Continues to guard access and renders `WorkspacePage` under the new layout defaults.
- `src/features/workspace/WorkspacePage.tsx`
  - Registers header, sidebar, and footer slots and wires project/editor navigation hooks.
- `src/app/layout/MainLayout.tsx`
  - Grid and spacing mirror the earlier shell while leaving sticky behaviour to the presentational components.

## Validation
- Workspace logic reviewed in code; end-to-end UI confirmation pending due to dev server sandbox limitations.
