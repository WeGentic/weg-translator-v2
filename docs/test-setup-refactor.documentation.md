# Test Setup Refactor Summary

## Scope
- Replaced the single `src/test/setup.ts` entry with a `src/test/setup/` module that centralizes global test bootstrap logic.
- Added router-aware helpers (`createMockAuth`, `renderWithRouter`) to support React 19 + TanStack Router scenarios during future test migrations.

## Integration Notes
- Vitest now loads `src/test/setup/index.ts`, which applies the jsdom `matchMedia` shim once and re-exports helper utilities.
- Existing tests can gradually adopt the shared helpers without additional per-suite polyfills.

## Follow-ups
- Remove duplicated `matchMedia` mocks from individual test suites while migrating tests in Task 8.2.
- Expand helpers with common render patterns (e.g., AppProviders stubs) as new modules require them.
