# Subtask 3.3 â€“ Toolbar Modernization (2025-02-22)

## Scope
- Completed Step 3.3 by realigning the v2 Project Manager toolbar with the centralized state/store introduced earlier in Task 3.
- Consolidated search, filter, and batch-delete interactions around selector-driven data to avoid prop drilling and redundant memoization.

## Implementation Highlights
- Rebuilt `ProjectManagerToolbar` with a semantic `role="toolbar"`, `aria-live` selection summaries, and a deferred search field that surfaces a dedicated clear control. The search input now shares store state without local memo wrappers, ensuring React 19 compiler compatibility.
- Converted `FilterControls` to consume the project manager store directly, exposing badge counts via `countActiveFilters` and sharing the same action methods across desktop and mobile popovers. Added disabled handling for in-flight mutations and inline reset actions.
- Extended `projectSelectors.ts` with preset-aware filtering helpers (`filterProjectsByPreset`) so `ProjectManagerContent` composes preset + search pipelines while pruning stale selections.
- Updated integration tests (`ProjectManagerShell.test.tsx`) to exercise the new filter flow, toolbar copy, and selection clear path, preventing regressions from the layout changes.

## React 19 / Accessibility Notes
- Toolbar actions now rely on pure selectors; no ad-hoc `useMemo` wrappers remain in the toolbar stack, letting the React compiler optimize event handlers natively.
- Added ARIA affordances for the toolbar (`role`, `aria-live`, `aria-label`) and placed tooltip support around the clear action to keep interactions discoverable.

## Validation
- `npm run test -- --run src/test/features/project-manager-v2/shell/ProjectManagerShell.test.tsx`
  - Confirms selection totals, toolbar delete orchestration, and filter badge counts.

## Follow-ups
- Sync upcoming sidebar overhaul (Task 4) with the new filter helpers so overview metrics reflect preset adjustments.
- Consider introducing tone-specific badges for status/type counts inside the toolbar once Ready for Step 4.2.3 theming audit.
