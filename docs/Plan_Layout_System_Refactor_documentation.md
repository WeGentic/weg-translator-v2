# Layout System Refactor â€” Progress Update

## Completed items
- Added `src/features/workspace/WorkspacePage.tsx` to host the workspace experience using layout slots for the header, sidemenu, and footer regions.
- Switched TanStack Router configuration to render the new layout by default, including static layout data for `/` and `/login` routes and a lean root route that mounts `MainLayout`.
- Enhanced `MainLayout` with aggregated layout metadata, sticky footer handling, and an accessible skip link.
- Stabilised the layout provider to reuse route-level static data, preventing redundant slot resets and the infinite render loop seen in `AppHeader`.
- Refactored `AppHeader`, `AppSidebar`, `WorkspaceFooter`, and `CollapsedFooterBar` to consume the centralized layout store rather than prop drilling state.
- Simplified legacy components (`App.tsx`, `CollapsedHeaderBar`, etc.) so they interoperate with the store-driven layout when used as a fallback.

## Notes & follow-ups
- `npm run build` currently fails because of pre-existing TypeScript issues in editor-related components (e.g., `RowActions`, `SegmentsTable` tests). No new failures were introduced by this work.
- Remaining plan items cover ScreenGuard consolidation, background variants, additional accessibility checks, and documentation of usage patterns.

## Suggested next steps
1. Tackle Task 6 (ScreenGuard) and Task 9 (background slots) to finish the core layout API.
2. Address accessibility verifications (Task 10.2/10.3) once remaining components are migrated.
3. Resolve the outstanding TypeScript errors in editor modules so CI can pass after the refactor lands.
