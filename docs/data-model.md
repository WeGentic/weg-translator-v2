# Data Model

The Weg Translator desktop app persists translation metadata in a bundled SQLite database (`weg_translator.db`). Migrations live in `src-tauri/migrations` and are embedded at build time. The schema contains two tables with a 1-to-1 relationship.

## `translation_jobs`

Stores the lifecycle state for every translation request that enters the system.

| Column           | Type    | Notes |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----- |
| `id`             | TEXT PK | UUID v4 identifying the job. |
| `source_language`| TEXT    | Required ISO/BCP-47 code supplied by the user. |
| `target_language`| TEXT    | Required ISO/BCP-47 code supplied by the user. |
| `input_text`     | TEXT    | Raw text payload queued for translation. |
| `status`         | TEXT    | Enum `queued\|running\|completed\|failed`; mirrors progress. |
| `stage`          | TEXT    | Enum `received\|preparing\|translating\|completed\|failed`; fine-grained pipeline stage. |
| `progress`       | REAL    | Normalised value `0.0`â€“`1.0`; database constraint enforces bounds. |
| `queued_at`      | TEXT    | ISO-8601 timestamp (UTC) of enqueue event. |
| `started_at`     | TEXT    | Nullable ISO-8601 timestamp when work began. |
| `completed_at`   | TEXT    | Nullable ISO-8601 timestamp when job succeeded. |
| `failed_at`      | TEXT    | Nullable ISO-8601 timestamp when job failed. |
| `failure_reason` | TEXT    | Optional human-friendly failure description. |
| `metadata`       | TEXT    | Optional JSON blob (stored as string) for client-supplied metadata. |
| `created_at`     | TEXT    | Insert timestamp (UTC). |
| `updated_at`     | TEXT    | Last mutation timestamp (UTC). |

**Indexes**

- `idx_translation_jobs_status` accelerates dashboard filters by status.
- `idx_translation_jobs_created_at` backs time-based ordering queries.

## `translation_outputs`

Captures the generated artefact for completed jobs.

| Column             | Type    | Notes |
| ------------------ | ------- | ----- |
| `job_id`           | TEXT PK | Foreign key to `translation_jobs(id)` (cascade delete). |
| `output_text`      | TEXT    | Persisted translation output. |
| `model_name`       | TEXT    | Optional hint about the LLM/engine that produced the output. |
| `input_token_count`| INTEGER | Optional usage metrics (defaults to `0`). |
| `output_token_count`| INTEGER| Optional usage metrics (defaults to `0`). |
| `total_token_count`| INTEGER | Optional usage metrics (defaults to `0`). |
| `duration_ms`      | INTEGER | End-to-end processing duration in milliseconds. |
| `created_at`       | TEXT    | Insert timestamp (UTC). |
| `updated_at`       | TEXT    | Last mutation timestamp (UTC). |

**Indexes**

- `idx_translation_outputs_created_at` supports quick sorting by newest output.

## Seed data

Migration `003_seed_demo_data.sql` ships a single sample record to populate the UI on first launch. The seed can safely run multiple times thanks to `INSERT OR IGNORE` guards on the known UUID. Remove the seed migration when shipping production builds that rely solely on live translation traffic.

## Query patterns

- Active queue snapshots read from `translation_jobs` (status `queued`/`running`).
- History views join `translation_jobs` with `translation_outputs` to display completion data and aggregate usage metrics.
- `DbManager::clear_history` removes rows where `status` is `completed` or `failed`, cascading into `translation_outputs` via the foreign key.

Refer to `src-tauri/src/db/mod.rs` for the authoritative query implementations and helper structs returned over IPC.
