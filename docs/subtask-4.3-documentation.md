# Sub-task 4.3 Documentation

## Summary
- Consolidated global theme tokens into `src/shared/styles/theme.css` and reduced `src/App.css` to shared-style imports plus Tailwind sources.
- Migrated gradient utilities, table motion keyframes, and supporting classes into `src/shared/styles/motion.css` with explicit `@layer` scoping.
- Relocated legacy layout CSS from `src/app/layout/css-styles/**` into `src/shared/styles/layout/**` and repointed layout components to the new paths.
- Verified shared assets in `src/assets` remain domain specific; no relocations required yet.

## Verification
- Manual import path checks across layout components (`src/app/layout/**/*.tsx`).
- Ensured old directories (`src/app/layout/css-styles`, `src/styles/table-animations.css`) are removed from the tree.
- No automated tests executed in this slice (pending consolidated test run in Task 10).

## Follow Ups
- Revisit shared asset consolidation after domain modules migrate additional icons/resources.
- Monitor Tailwind build output during the next lint/type/test cycle to confirm layer ordering remains stable.
