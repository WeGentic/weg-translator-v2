# Task 1 â€“ Migration Strategy & Directory Layout Summary

_Date: 2025-02-15_

## Scope
Task 1 covered planning work for the Project Manager v2 initiative:
- Sub-task 1.1: finalised module boundaries, dependency classification, and directory mapping.
- Sub-task 1.2: ensured the legacy module can run alongside v2 via feature flags, outlined copy-only workflows, and documented rollback safeguards.

## Key Deliverables
- `Plan_ProjectManagerV2_React19_Refactor.md` updated with current statuses, migration matrix, copy-only checklist, and rollout notes.
- `docs/ProjectManagerV2_DirectoryLayout.md` expanded to include the directory tree and copy-only migration workflow.
- `docs/Subtask1_1_Migration_Strategy_documentation.md` summarising classification, dependencies, and layout decisions.
- `docs/Subtask1_2_Rollback_Strategy_documentation.md` detailing the layered rollback approach (feature flag kill switch + Tauri updater fallback).
- Introduced `src/lib/feature-flags.ts` and `src/features/project-manager-v2/ProjectManagerRoute.tsx` placeholder to keep the build stable while v2 is under construction.

## Validation
- Feature flag defaults to legacy implementation, ensuring no behavioural regressions while Task 2 proceeds.
- Copy-only plan and rollback documentation reviewed to guarantee legacy parity is preserved throughout the migration.

## Next Steps
1. Begin Task 2 by designing `useProjectsResource` and Suspense boundaries as per plan.
2. Implement copy-only duplication script outlined in the workflow before starting structural refactors.
3. Wire remote flag configuration and monitoring hooks described in the rollback strategy during Task 5.

Feedback welcome on additional safeguards or documentation needed before advancing to Task 2.
