# Sub-task 5.2 Documentation

## Summary
- Relocated the authentication context into `src/app/providers/auth` and exposed cohesive exports via `src/app/providers`.
- Added `AppProviders` composition component (`src/app/providers/index.tsx`) to layer logging, error boundary, auth, and toast providers consistently across entry points.
- Updated `main.tsx`, `App.tsx`, UI components, and tests to rely on the new provider namespace; confirmed global state already resides under `src/app/state`.

## Verification
- Searched for legacy `@/contexts/AuthContext` imports to ensure all call sites shifted to `@/app/providers`.
- Manually inspected `main.tsx` render tree to confirm provider order matches the previous implementation.
- No automated tests executed in this slice (covered in Task 10).

## Follow Ups
- Plan future refactors to split auth API/service logic into `src/modules/auth` during domain migration (Task 7.5).
- Consider adding provider-focused unit tests once modules stabilize to guarantee provider composition order.
