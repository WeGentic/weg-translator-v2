# Task 5 â€“ Resources Page Placeholder

## Overview
- Added new TanStack Router entry at `src/routes/resources/index.tsx` wired to the `/resources` path.
- Implemented the three-zone panel scaffold (Header, Toolbar, Content, Footer) using `@wegentic/layout-three-zone` exports.
- Emitted `app:navigate` events with `view: "resource"` so existing sidebar listeners receive route focus updates.

## Layout Highlights
- Header exposes staged `Import` and `Sync` actions to mirror future resource management flows.
- Toolbar combines a search field with type/status shadcn selects plus quick action buttons, matching dashboard responsiveness.
- Content section delivers summary cards and an empty-state resource library block using palette-compliant Tailwind utility classes.

## Follow-up Suggestions
- Connect sidebar navigation handlers in `src/routes/__root.tsx` to route to `/resources` (Task 8).
- Replace placeholder metrics and cards with live resource data once backend APIs are available.
- Expand toolbar filters when additional resource classifications or sync states are introduced.
