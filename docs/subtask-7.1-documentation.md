# Sub-task 7.1 Documentation

## Summary
- Migrated the project manager feature from `src/features/project-manager-v2` and the supporting UI from `src/components/projects/**` into `src/modules/projects`, centralising domain assets under a single module.
- Added `state/` to host table filter state, sidebar sync hooks, and filtering utilities with barrel exports, and created a module-level `ProjectsPanel` wrapper to preserve existing entry points.
- Updated workspace integration, app shell, and test imports to consume the new `@/modules/projects` namespace.

## Verification
- Searched for legacy `@/features/project-manager-v2` and `@/components/projects` imports to confirm all callers target the module path.
- Manually loaded `WorkspacePage` route component (via static analysis) to ensure the migrated module composes correctly; automated tests pending Task 10.

## Follow Ups
- When other domain modules migrate (Tasks 7.2+), review cross-module imports to ensure only shared utilities remain under `@/modules/projects/ui`.
- Consider moving benchmark/test fixtures into a co-located `__tests__` once remaining project-manager tests are relocated alongside the module.
