# Sub-task 7.2 Documentation

## Summary
- Migrated workspace presentation from `src/features/workspace` into `src/modules/workspace`, including new `hooks/` and `state/` folders for navigation concerns.
- Relocated `useWorkspaceShell` and `useGlobalNavigationEvents` into the module namespace and refreshed consumers (legacy app shell, workspace page, tests) to import from the new barrels.
- Ensured workspace UI now references project components via `@/modules/projects/ui/*`, removing residual links to the old `src/components/projects` tree.

## Verification
- Searched for `@/features/workspace` and verified only documentation references remain.
- Manually inspected workspace route wiring (`src/router/routes/index.tsx`) and legacy `App.tsx` to ensure they render the module-based workspace page.
- Automated tests deferred to Task 10; no immediate run performed in this slice.

## Follow Ups
- When projects/history modules gain additional hooks, evaluate whether any remaining workspace state should move to shared stores.
- Consider adding module-level tests for navigation events once the router migrations are complete.
