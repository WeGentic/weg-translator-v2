# Task 4 â€“ Dashboard Placeholder Implementation

## Routing
- Registered `/dashboard` via file-based route (`src/routes/dashboard/index.tsx`) using `createFileRoute("/dashboard")`.
- Verified root layout already mounts `<Outlet />`, so no structural changes were needed in `src/routes/__root.tsx`.

## Layout & Composition
- Rendered `ThreeZonePanel` with a header summarizing the dashboard and a `New Project` primary action.
- Toolbar includes search, filter, and quick action buttons laid out responsively with ShadCN controls.
- Content slot hosts a placeholder grid of cards describing future widgets (activity timeline, quick links, KPI widget, active jobs).
- Footer summarizes last update and project statistics using muted styling consistent with the projects table footer pattern.

## Follow-up
- Integrate real data sources once backend APIs for dashboards exist.
- Revisit toolbar actions when filter/query requirements are defined.
