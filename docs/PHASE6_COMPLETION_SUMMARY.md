## Risk Assessment

### High Risks (Mitigated)

1. **Email Delivery Failure** → Dual provider strategy (Resend + SendGrid)
2. **Orphan Detection Timeout** → Fail-closed with retry logic (3 attempts)
3. **Rate Limit Attack** → Three-tier limits with PostgreSQL-based enforcement
4. **Timing Attacks** → Constant-time responses with Gaussian jitter
5. **Distributed Lock Deadlock** → Advisory locks with 30-second timeout

### Medium Risks (Monitored)

1. **Database Performance** → Indexes, LIMIT 1, parallel queries, monitoring
2. **Email Bounce Rate** → DNS configuration (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), monitoring
3. **User Confusion** → Clear UI messages, prominent recovery options, help docs

### Low Risks (Acceptable)

1. **Feature Flag Dependency** → Clear rollback procedures, tested in staging
2. **Cold Start Latency** → Edge functions optimize for fast cold starts
3. **Cache Invalidation** → 2-minute TTL with force refresh option

---

## Rollback Readiness

### Emergency Rollback (2-5 minutes)

```bash
# Step 1: Disable feature flag
VITE_ORPHAN_CLEANUP_ENABLED=false
vercel deploy --prod

# Step 2: Verify
curl https://yourdomain.com/health
# Expected: Feature flag disabled, old flows active
```

### Full Rollback (10-30 minutes)

```bash
# Step 1: Disable feature flag (as above)

# Step 2: Remove edge functions (if causing issues)
supabase functions delete cleanup-orphaned-user

# Step 3: Revert frontend code
git revert HEAD
npm run build
vercel deploy --prod

# Step 4: Rollback database (ONLY IF NECESSARY)
# ⚠️ Warning: Loss of audit trail
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/rollback-orphan-cleanup.sql
```

### Rollback Testing
