# Plan Project Manager V2 Final Verification — 2025-10-06

## Scope
- Confirmed Task 2–5 milestones in `Plan_ProjectManagerV2_React19_Refactor.md` reached completion without regressions.
- Focus on optimistic mutations, Suspense-powered data flow, React 19 compiler readiness, and QA coverage.

## Findings
1. **Data lifecycle (Task 2)**
   - `useProjectsResource` suspends on first load, retains Tauri event listeners, and exposes invalidate/refresh helpers consistent with React 19 guidance from 2025-10-06 web research.
   - Mutation hooks (`useCreateProjectAction`, `useDeleteProjectAction`, `useBatchDeleteProjectsAction`) share optimistic cache updates with rollback safety via `mutateProjectsResource`.
   - Toast copy centralised in actions; verified pending states bubble through `useActionState` without stale snapshots.
2. **Shell + compiler compliance (Task 3)**
   - `ProjectManagerShell` scopes state via Zustand provider, avoids unnecessary memoisation, and reuses static selectors for the React Compiler.
   - Table pipeline (`useProjectsTable`, `projectsTableColumns`) provides stable column meta and merges selection with shared store to eliminate inline handlers.
3. **Shared hooks/components (Task 4)**
   - `useSidebarContentSync` coordinates overview vs. batch panels with deterministic cleanup.
   - Table + sidebar share selection data; palette tokens align with WeGentic spec across hover/selected states.
4. **QA + documentation (Task 5)**
   - Vitest suites (`ProjectManagerShell.test.tsx`, `mutationActions.test.tsx`) cover Suspense fallbacks, optimistic flows, and error handling.
   - Existing docs under `docs/Subtask5_*` remain accurate; no gaps detected for new behaviours.

## Outcome
- Updated plan file statuses to **Completed** for Tasks 2–5 and appended a verification audit entry.
- No code changes required beyond plan/documentation alignment.
- Ready for user feedback before proceeding to rollout or additional enhancements.
