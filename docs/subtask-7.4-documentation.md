# Sub-task 7.4 Documentation

## Summary
- Relocated `DashboardView`, header, toolbar, and content primitives into `src/modules/dashboard/view` with a local barrel so the module owns its UI surface.
- Removed the legacy `src/features/dashboard` directory and updated the module index to re-export the dashboard view for downstream consumers.
- Rewired TanStack route registration and workspace shell navigation to consume the module namespace, keeping imports consistent with other domains.

## Verification
- Grepped for `@/features/dashboard` to ensure only documentation references remain.
- Confirmed `src/modules/dashboard/routes/index.tsx` renders the module view and `WorkspacePage` imports from `@/modules/dashboard`.
- Manually inspected the relocated components to ensure styling still references the shared `main-view.css` scaffold.

## Follow Ups
- Fill in dashboard analytics data and domain services once backend endpoints are ready; add dedicated state/services folders at that time.
- Revisit tests when dashboard gains interactive logic so coverage mirrors the new module structure.
