# Task 2 Alias Tooling Documentation

## Completed Work
- Extended `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.node.json` with explicit `@/core/*`, `@/shared/*`, and `@/modules/*` path mappings while keeping the legacy `@/*` alias.
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to register the same aliases so dev/build pipelines resolve the domain-first folders.
- Switched ESLint's type-aware presets to `parserOptions.project: true` with the repo root as `tsconfigRootDir`, ensuring lint rules load the refreshed path map. Prettier already targets `**/*` so no changes required there.
- Added Tailwind v4 `@source "./src/modules"` and `@source "./src/shared"` directives to `src/App.css` so utility extraction tracks the new directory structure without adding legacy glob configuration.

## Verification
- Verified the plan file reflects the new configuration status and documents why Prettier needed no adjustments.
- Confirmed `tsconfig.node.json` now mirrors the alias map for Vitest/Vite Node contexts.
- Did not rerun automated tooling; CSS-only change scoped to Tailwind source detection.

## Follow-Ups
- Review shared theme extraction (Task 4.3) once `src/shared/styles/theme.css` lands to ensure the new `@source` directives continue to cover all Tailwind utility call sites.
