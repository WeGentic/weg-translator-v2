# Projects UI Revamp â€” Task 4 Documentation (Integration & State Management)

## Scope
- Integrated the new ProjectsDataTable into ProjectsPanel with non-breaking behavior.
- Lifted table state (sorting, search, filters) to ProjectsPanel for stability during polling.
- Reworked panel header and loading/notification UX.

## Changes
- Panel state:
  - Added `tableSorting`, `tableSearch`, `tableFilters` in `src/components/projects/ProjectsPanel.tsx`.
  - Passed controlled props to `ProjectsDataTable` to persist user choices across data refreshes.
- Header & layout:
  - Header now shows title and a live project count badge.
  - Create and Refresh actions live in the table toolbar to align controls.
  - Adjusted toolbar to non-sticky and increased table row padding to improve spacing from header.
- Loading UX:
  - Introduced `ProjectsTableSkeleton` (Tailwind skeleton) to replace the spinner during loading.
- Notifications:
  - Replaced ad-hoc snack overlay with `useToast()` success/destructive toasts.

## Files Touched
- src/components/projects/ProjectsPanel.tsx
- src/components/projects/table/ProjectsDataTable.tsx
- src/components/projects/table/ProjectsTableSkeleton.tsx

## Notes
- All changes are backward-compatible. Toolbar is non-sticky per feedback; header-to-row spacing improved; cell typography reduced for alignment.
- Next: Add optional icons for empty states and document responsive breakpoints.

## Next Steps
- Complete Task 4.2.3 and 4.2.5 (empty/error polish, responsive doc).
- Move to Task 5 visual polish and Task 6 tests.
