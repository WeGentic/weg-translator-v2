# Task 5 â€“ Backend IPC Read/Write Summary

- Completed: 2025-02-14
- Added secure artifact accessors in `src-tauri/src/ipc/commands.rs`: `read_project_artifact` and `update_jliff_segment` sanitize relative paths against the canonical project root, reject traversal, and surface friendly validation errors.
- Introduced reusable helpers (`read_project_artifact_impl`, `update_jliff_segment_impl`) plus project-root resolution utilities for reuse and testing.
- Defined `UpdateJliffSegmentResultDto` (Rust) and `UpdateJliffSegmentResult` (TS) to expose update metadata; TypeScript client bindings now available via `readProjectArtifact` / `updateJliffSegment` in `src/ipc/client.ts`.
- Added integration coverage in `src-tauri/tests/ipc_artifacts.rs` validating happy path, missing transunit, and basic read flows backed by in-memory SQLite + temp project directories.

Next steps: leverage these IPC endpoints during Task 6 data loading to hydrate the editor view with JLIFF/tag-map artifacts.
