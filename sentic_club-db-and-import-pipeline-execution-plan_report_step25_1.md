# Step 25.1 Dual-write Report

## Summary
- Implemented transitional dual-write support so project seeding writes both to the new `file_targets` model and the legacy `project_file_conversions` table, avoiding drift during rollout.

## Implementation Details
- Updated `ProjectService::seed_project_metadata` to stage `NewProjectFileConversion` rows for convertible files (respecting existing extension filters) in the same transaction that inserts `file_targets`, ensuring atomic dual writes (`src-tauri/src/ipc/commands/projects/service.rs`).
- Extended `SeededProjectFile` metadata with file extensions to support selective legacy conversion seeding (`src-tauri/src/ipc/commands/projects/service.rs`).
- Added unit coverage verifying convertible files receive pending legacy conversions while skip-list extensions do not, sustaining backward compatibility expectations (`src-tauri/src/ipc/commands/projects/service.rs`).
- Marked the execution plan step as complete with traceable notes in `sentic_club-db-and-import-pipeline-execution-plan.md`.

## Testing
- `cargo test -p weg-translator seed_project_metadata_dual_writes`
